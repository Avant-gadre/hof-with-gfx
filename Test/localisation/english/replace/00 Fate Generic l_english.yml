 intro.0.desc: "Credit: Part of Germany design, setting, flags, and some of icons are from famous Fuhrerreich Mod and TNO(the new order) Mod. Please check it on the steam workshop if you like it. \n This mod is a TypeMoon-themed and Anime-themed mod, try to blend the WWII world, or the historical world, with characters from TypeMoon ACG series, especially Fate Series, made by a small group lead by Entarogan. This mod does not adopt the original type-moon universe and keep the realistic WWII universe instead. Concepts like servant, Grail War and Root, do not make sense here. Grail, Alaya, Magic, etc. should be interpreted as religious and political symbols. \n All ideologies, religious,racial,national ideas are simulations of those real exsits in history or TM original works and are not any real ideas held by any one of authors. The authors are opposite to all kinds of racism,fascism,nazism,terrorism and respect every nation and religion beliefs.\n Forgive me for my Chinglish please."
