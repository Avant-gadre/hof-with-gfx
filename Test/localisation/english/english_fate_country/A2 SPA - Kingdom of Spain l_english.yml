##Focus
 spainish_focus: "Spanish National Focus"
 SPA_restauracion: "Restauración"
 SPA_restauracion_desc: "Now that we have won the civil war, we must first focus on entrenching the newly restored legitimate branch of the House of Borbón. A significant period of reconstruction will be needed to repair the lives of the king's subjects, but soon Spain shall have restored itself to greatness."
 SPA_rey: "Rey"
 SPA_rey_desc: "The concept of national sovereignty is rejected. Sovereignty is vested on the king, both legitimate in blood and in deeds. But this power is limited by the doctrine of the Church and the Laws and Usages of the Kingdom, and through a series of Councils, traditional Cortes and state-independent intermediate bodies."
 SPA_furos: "Fueros"
 SPA_furos_desc: "Natural law and its justice tells us to treat the equal as equal and the unequal as unequal. This is determined by the traditional charters respected by the king and his subjects. Abolished by Elisabeth II almost a century ago, now is the time to rebirth traditional law and recover the right laws that bind our community together."
 SPA_mending_the_rift: "Heal the Soul of our Nation"
 SPA_mending_the_rift_desc: "Despite languishing under the rule of Liberals, Secularists and Anarchists for decades, Spain's Soul still remains as our recent success has shown. Though the process will take a long time, under our rule Spain can finally prosper and the rift between the crown and the people of Spain will disappear."
 SPA_crush_opposition: "Crusade against Syndicalism"
 SPA_crush_opposition_desc: "Spain was on the brink of falling to the godless enemies of Christendom but we answered the call of nation and Mother Church. Under the banners of the Sacred Heart, the Requetes shall march against the remaining traitors!"
 SPA_dios: "Dios"
 SPA_dios_desc: "Dios or Faith in God and the Catholic church is a central tenet of Carlism. The Kings of Spain have long had the title of Catholic Monarch and Catholic Majesty though they have not always lived up to these titles. We on the other hand shall live up to these titles."
 SPA_patria: "Patria"
 SPA_patria_desc: "Fatherland is what binds all Spaniards together. Spain is not just a nation, it is the community of the faithful Catholics who honour tradition and live according to the laws and customs of its ancestors, as tradition dictates. Liberalism has only brought the freedom to sin, to degenerate and the libertinism to defy Holy Name of God. Our nation emerges from the natural law of human communities, and as such will be recognised."
 SPA_the_crusade_against_democracy: "The Crusade Against Democracy"
 SPA_the_crusade_against_democracy_desc: "Only the rightful Carlist heir has been invested, by God Himself, with the divine right to rule. Democracy is not only an insult to the King, it is also blasphemy against the very Will of God. This blight must not be allowed to exist upon this world any longer."
 SPA_defenders_of_catholicism: "Defenders of Catholicism"
 SPA_defenders_of_catholicism_desc: "As it was four hundred years ago, Spain must again be the defender of the Catholic faith. By extension, the common soldier must be the sword and shield of his faith, and bear this sacred duty in mind wherever his King might send him to fight."
 SPA_battle_rites: "Battle Rites"
 SPA_battle_rites_desc: "Warfare in defense of our nation is a sacred duty. Our chaplains will accompany the soldiers on the battlefield and administer the last rites on the spot for any who give the ultimate sacrifice for King and Faith, ensuring that all are rewarded in Heaven."
 SPA_cultivate_fanaticism: "Cultivate Fanaticism"
 SPA_cultivate_fanaticism_desc: "The Carlist soldier's most admirable traits are his tenacity and unflinching resolve in the face of danger and hardship, in the knowledge that God will reward them for their duty should they fall. This dedication and sacrifice of the fallen should be held up as an example to strive towards for all new recruits."
 SPA_expand_the_requetes: "Expand the Requetés"
 SPA_expand_the_requetes_desc: "We have relied upon a relatively small, but comparatively well-trained force of assault troops so far. Our ambitions require much more, however. We must expand these Requetés and provide the necessary training for all who answer the hunting call."
 SPA_militarize_the_masses: "Militarize the Masses"
 SPA_militarize_the_masses_desc: "The values for which we stand cannot be defended by our Requetés alone. All who are loyal to the Crown and bear the love of God in their hearts must do their military duty in the defense of their ideals."
 SPA_cortes_espanolas: "Cortes Españolas"
 SPA_cortes_espanolas_desc: "The Cortes Españolas will be the new legislature of the kingdom of Spain representing not a liberal parliament but the ancient and traditional cortes that existed since the medieval era. The Cortes Españolas will be the highest law of the land and the King will be no figurehead in deciding the laws here."
 SPA_viva_el_rey: "Viva El Rey!"
 SPA_viva_el_rey_desc: "At long last the conflicts that have plagued our country are over and we can bask in the joy that comes with peace. Throughout Spain many of our subjects are cheering \"Long Live the King\" for the period of peace and prosperity [SPA.getleader] has brought to the nation."
 SPA_consolidate_spain: "Consolidate Spain"
 SPA_consolidate_spain_desc: "Now is the time to look across the country and see what must be done to pull it together, and to heal the rifts which have formed since the end of the Second Republic."
 SPA_the_popular_front: "The Popular Front"
 SPA_the_popular_front_desc: "The danger posed by Fascism and religious superstitions to our personal liberties is paramount, and we must establish a broad front of political parties that are united in their opposition to the Right. Only if we band together will we be able to halt their advance and save our republic."
 SPA_the_popular_army: "The Popular Army"
 SPA_the_popular_army_desc: "Our new army will be made up of those untainted by the treachery of the military; those among the population who are zealous in their defense of the principles upon which the Republic is built, but who perhaps did not serve previously. Coupled with this reorganization we will also develop new arms and doctrines to aid this new army in their fight."
 SPA_distribute_arms_to_the_people: "Distribute Arms to the People"
 SPA_distribute_arms_to_the_people_desc: "Disloyalty in the military is now all but certain, and it is clear we cannot rely on them to defend the values of the Republic. We should begin disseminating arms to those who carry the best interests of the Republic at heart, so that they may form the first defense against a possible rebellion."
 SPA_no_pasaran: "¡No Pasarán!"
 SPA_no_pasaran_desc: "Let the creed of the anti-fascist echo from every home in every city; from every rooftop to every street; from every barricade to every ditch: \"¡No Pasarán!\" - they shall not pass!"
 SPA_foreign_arms_purchases: "Foreign Arms Purchases"
 SPA_foreign_arms_purchases_desc: "The gold reserves we 'liberated' could be used to obtain foreign arms, which we are in desperate need of. International opinion is not necessarily supportive of us, so we will likely have to go through unorthodox channels to receive these, however..."
 SPA_against_fascism: "Against Fascism"
 SPA_against_fascism_desc: "The fascist enemy may have been defeated on the Iberia peninsula, but it still exists beyond our borders. We must join the international fight to extinguish it once and for all."
 SPA_patrullas_de_control: "Patrullas de Control"
 SPA_patrullas_de_control_desc: "The Guardia Civil is an inherently oppressive organisation that must be abolished. In its place we will institute the Patrullas de Control, Control Patrols, to upkeep public order in the new Republic."
 SPA_unbreakable_spirit: "Unbreakable Spirit"
 SPA_unbreakable_spirit_desc: "With the revolution in our hearts we will not surrender after a few simple battles. We will fight battle after battle until we have emerged victorious."
 SPA_new_leadership: "New Leadership"
 SPA_new_leadership_desc: "New leadership is required for the Republic to survive these trying times. We will bring in advisors and ministers with new perspectives on how to best combat the fascist threat, allowing us to better safeguard our principles and beliefs."
 SPA_militia_focus: "Soldiers of the Revolution"
 SPA_militia_focus_desc: "Our first order of business is to look to our army - to ensure that it consists of hard workers, those devoted to the new socialist order. Anyone who still holds to the old ways, or who clings too much to faith as more important than their ideology, must be summarily purged from the ranks and replaced with true members of the working class."
 SPA_solidify_government_control: "Solidify Government Control"
 SPA_solidify_government_control_desc: "The autonomous states throughout the country must have their liberties curtailed for the good of the whole. We cannot let them weaken our unity in the face of fascist threats abroad."
 SPA_fortify_the_iron_ring: "Fortify the Iron Ring"
 SPA_fortify_the_iron_ring_desc: "The largest city in the Basque Country, Bilbao, will receive its own 'Iron Ring' of fortifications, allowing the Basques a formidable obstacle from which to defend it against the fascist enemy."
 SPA_disband_the_army: "Disband the Army"
 SPA_disband_the_army_desc: "We can no longer ignore the signs of disloyalty in the military. Even if it may spark the plotters into action, we have no choice but to attempt to disband the army with immediate effect, and seize the initiative."
 SPA_take_the_initiative: "Take the Initiative"
 SPA_take_the_initiative_desc: "We cannot remain idle while our enemies choose when and where to attack us. Wars are won by showing initiative, and so that is what we must do."
 SPA_anti_fascist_unity: "Anti-Fascist Unity"
 SPA_anti_fascist_unity_desc: "Disagreements between our anarchist and anti-Stalinist allies and ourselves are growing worse. We cannot afford this escalating out of control. We must re-focus our attentions on the true enemy, even if the price for internal peace is government-level concessions to our wayward allies."
 SPA_reaffirm_the_popular_front_strategy: "Reaffirm the Popular Front Strategy"
 SPA_reaffirm_the_popular_front_strategy_desc: "It is imperative that the differences between us and our allies are, for the moment, forgotten, so that we may all focus on the more important fight: against the fascists."
 SPA_a_great_spain: "A Great Spain"
 SPA_a_great_spain_desc: "The fledgling Second Republic has failed in its duties to protect religion, family, and property. As the Left beleaguers our Christian civilization, the Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas will stand in its defense and give Spain true unity and a new spirit. Parliament will submit to the will of the people, or we will eliminate it."
 SPA_relocate_the_gold_reserves: "Relocate the Gold Reserves"
 SPA_relocate_the_gold_reserves_desc: "Our gold reserves are key in the purchase of war materials from abroad. We must ensure it is stored in a safe location, which unfortunately necessitates moving it abroad."
 SPA_negotiate_carlist_support: "Negotiate Carlist Support"
 SPA_negotiate_carlist_support_desc: "Our cause has allies we but need to reach out to. Anti-clerical sentiment from the Left has antagonized the Carlists, who have long been preparing for a confrontation with the Republic. Should we gain their support, our uprising will be much strengthened."
 SPA_the_army_of_africa: "The Army of Africa"
 SPA_the_army_of_africa_desc: "The key to victory in the upcoming struggle is the seasoned Army of Africa. We must ensure their loyalty to our cause, draw up plans for the lightning occupation of North Africa, and then prepare the transfer of these battle-hardened troops to the mainland where they can swing the balance in our favor."
 SPA_integrate_the_requetes: "Integrate the Requetés"
 SPA_integrate_the_requetes_desc: "Those Carlist Requetés who are more amenable to our way of thinking should be integrated more closely into our armed forces. Their experience and training will be invaluable in the fight ahead."
 SPA_hand_over_the_ceda_campaign_chest: "Hand Over the CEDA Campaign Chest"
 SPA_hand_over_the_ceda_campaign_chest_desc: "We have ample funds remaining after our electoral campaign. In the event that Parliament rejects our voice, we must prepare for its elimination. We will hand over the campaign chest of the Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas to the enlightened parts of the military, so that they may prepare their uprising against the Left."
 SPA_secure_the_northern_garrisons: "Secure the Northern Garrisons"
 SPA_secure_the_northern_garrisons_desc: "Using the proper 'encouragement' we will obtain the support of the garrison commanders in the North. With a well-timed concurrent uprising this will give us a solid power-base from which to wage our war against the Leftists, if our initial coup attempt should fail."
 SPA_con_paquito: "Con Paquito"
 SPA_con_paquito_desc: "Our cause needs strong leaders, and Francisco Franco commands the loyalty of the vaunted Army of Africa. For our uprising to succeed, and despite his dallying in making a decision, we must enlist his support, though this will likely come at a price..."
 SPA_save_the_alcazar: "Save the Alcázar!"
 SPA_save_the_alcazar_desc: "The Alcázar in Toledo is still held by forces loyal to our cause, but they are under siege! Liberating them, though not strategically important, would be a major propaganda victory, and cement Francisco Franco's position as de facto leader of the military junta."
 SPA_extol_the_martyrs_of_the_war: "Extol the Martyrs of the War"
 SPA_extol_the_martyrs_of_the_war_desc: "Those who have laid down their lives for our cause should be remembered and honored for their sacrifice. Their actions should serve as an example to us all."
 SPA_requetes: "Requeté"
 SPA_requetes_desc: "The Requetés have long been part of the Carlist army since the first Carlist War. While they were originally militias, we should look at reforming them into the elite force of the new Spanish army. Their high religious fervour and their distinctive red berets shall serve as an inspiration to the rest of the troops."
 SPA_sin_paquito: "Sin Paquito"
 SPA_sin_paquito_desc: "The government, fearing his potential disloyalty, has sent Francisco Franco to command the forces in the Canarias. However, despite our invitations, he has not promised us his support either, and merely delays us with his indecisiveness. If \"Miss Canary Islands 1936\" will not decide to join us, then we will simply proceed without him."
 SPA_devoted_officers: "Devoted Officers"
 SPA_devoted_officers_desc: "The new Spanish Army shall be known for its devoted officers, soldiers devoted equally both to their King and to their Catholic faith. These officers will provide an excellent example for the rest of our troops, allowing them to fight on no matter the odds."
 SPA_walls_of_jericho: "Break the Walls of Jericho"
 SPA_walls_of_jericho_desc: "As the Walls of old Jericho fell to the righteous soldiers of God, so too will the defences of our enemies. Our grand railway artillery shall serve as our trumpets, with a loud shout their frontlines will crumble."
 SPA_word_of_god: "Word of God"
 SPA_word_of_god_desc: "The radio has been a useful tool saving many a soldier's life during the civil war, leading to their nickname of the \"Word of God\". With how useful these radios have been, we should invest in further radio technology to help ensure more of our troops survive."
 SPA_a_catholic_army: "A Catholic Army"
 SPA_a_catholic_army_desc: "Regardless of the particular reforms that we have decided upon, the one thing that we can say is that the Army of Spain is a Catholic army, from the highest of generals to the most lowly of soldiers. God shall be with the army of Spain."
 SPA_a_methodical_approach: "A Methodical Approach"
 SPA_a_methodical_approach_desc: "The key to success in this civil war lies not in bold maneuvers and reckless attacks, but in careful and methodical planning and deliberate and precise attacks."
 SPA_fortify_madrid: "Fortify Madrid"
 SPA_fortify_madrid_desc: "Our capital, here in the heart of Spain, is also our weakest link. It can easily be surrounded, and our enemies know that capturing the Royal Family would ensure we instantly lay down our arms. We cannot allow this to happen, even if it means turning beautiful Madrid into a veritable fortress."
 SPA_roads_of_war: "The Roads of War"
 SPA_roads_of_war_desc: "Even during the times of Roman Hispania roads were vital not only to daily life but also to warfare. Without a proper network of roads, and in the modern age railways, supplying and repositioning troops is near impossible. By improving the roads of eastern Spain, we can ensure that any uprising can quickly organise itself into a proper frontline."
 SPA_defend_burgos: "The Stronghold of Burgos"
 SPA_defend_burgos_desc: "Burgos has been firmly established as the metaphorical stronghold of the Carlist movement, with the government having already lost de facto control of the city. If the Carlist movement is to succeed, Burgos must be transformed into a much less metaphorical stronghold. Defensive positions should be established throughout the city, and even the old castle can be home to anti-air batteries to ensure Javier's ultimate triumph."
 SPA_call_for_unity: "Royal Unity"
 SPA_call_for_unity_desc: "Throughout this period of healing and reconcillation our nation has had to go through, our King has acted as a uniting beacon of stability. No matter the political changes or disagreements we experience, [SPA.getleader] and his successors will always be with us to guide our nation forward."
 SPA_rights_spanish: "Restore the Rights of the Spanish"
 SPA_rights_spanish_desc: "Since Primo de Rivera's coup in 1923, the Spanish Constitution has remained suspended, which evidently has not mended the rifts in Spanish society as shown by the outbreak of civil war. Therefore the Spanish Constitution will be restored and the fundamental rights of the Spanish will be recognised, so long as the exercise of these rights does not go against the spiritual, national and social unity of Spain."
 SPA_new_constitution: "Absorb the Carlists"
 SPA_new_constitution_desc: "Though misguided in their struggle against us, the Carlists have far more in common with us than the anarchists. With our shared beliefs in God, Family and Country, it will not be difficult to ally them and bring peace to this troubled land."
 SPA_fortify_the_central_government: "Fortify the Central Government"
 SPA_fortify_the_central_government_desc: "We must fortify the government against communist influence, lest they surreptitiously manage to take take control of the Republic from within."
 SPA_secure_democratic_principles: "Secure Democratic Principles"
 SPA_secure_democratic_principles_desc: "We cannot let communist influence alter or even destroy the principles upon which the Second Republic was founded - no matter our relationship to the communists or [SOV.GetNameDef], these principles must be carried in our hearts, if not openly."
 SPA_the_stabilization_plan: "The Stabilization Plan"
 SPA_the_stabilization_plan_desc: "We must steer away from the unreasonable Falangist dream of autarky and the untenable economic policies implemented in its pursuit. To achieve economic parity with the rest of the world we must look at economic liberalization instead, hopefully triggering an economic boom that will benefit all Spaniards."
 SPA_unity_at_last: "A National Movement"
 SPA_unity_at_last_desc: "We must aim to be a movement above petty party politics that any true Spaniard can rally behind. The Liberals, Marxists and Freemasons dare to threaten our great nation but they shall never succeed, for we have our Catholic faith beside us and once Spain has been united, the world will know that we are whole and not to be trifled with."
 SPA_municipal_reorg: "Municipal Reorganisation"
 SPA_municipal_reorg_desc: "Carrying on from the Municipal Statute of 1924, José Calvo Sotelo has proposed further reorganisation of municipalities in order to finally regenerate municipal and political life and vanquish the plague of caciquismo. Provincial and local authorities will be replaced by trusted men to ensure that no forms of corruption will exist."
 SPA_safeguard_the_freedom_of_worship: "Safeguard The Freedom of Worship"
 SPA_safeguard_the_freedom_of_worship_desc: "The Republicans threaten the faith in God itself, and we must make it clear to everyone that we are Christianity's last bastion. We will protect all Christians' right and freedom of worship, and all who wish may join our fight in their defense."
 SPA_national_catholicism: "National Catholicism"
 SPA_national_catholicism_desc: "The rules and teachings of the Catholic church will be an integral part of Spanish Law. The church will have pride of place in making the laws while [SPA.getleader] will make sure that the church is protected."
 SPA_corporate_state: "A Corporate State"
 SPA_corporate_state_desc: "Society will be centred around the natural bodies of association: the family, where one is born; the municipality, where one lives; the union, where one works. The exercise of any individual right is conditioned to the decisions made by these traditional social corporations while issues relating to religion will be handled by ecclesiastical organisations."
 SPA_charter_of_labour: "Fuero del Trabajo"
 SPA_charter_of_labour_desc: "A Charter of Labour will be drafted to resolve the issues caused by labour disputes and revolutionary unions. It's provisions will include the prohibition of strikes, the regulation of working hours and of rest, the creation of the Magistracy of Labour and the creation of the Spanish Trade Union Organisation as a sole trade union, which will group employers and workers equally, both subordinated to the decisions of the State."
 SPA_organic_democracy: "Organic Democracy"
 SPA_organic_democracy_desc: "Instead of petty things like liberal principles, parliamentarism, political parties, and universal suffrage, Spanish Democracy will be based on natural social institutions such as the Family or Municipality, ensuring that Party Politics will cease to corrupt the Spanish people. A bicameral system will be created: Legislative power will be exercised by a Congress elected by universal suffrage  and by a Senate representing organised social interests."
 SPA_reconcilliation: "Integrate Alfonsist Remnants"
 SPA_reconcilliation_desc: "Though misguided in their struggle against us, the Alfonsists have far more in common with us than the anarchists. With our shared beliefs in God, King and Country, it will not be difficult to ally them and bring peace to this troubled land."
 SPA_caudillo_of_spain: "Caudillo of Spain"
 SPA_caudillo_of_spain_desc: "Francisco Franco's achievements have spoken for themselves, and his potential rivals have met untimely ends. Support among the junta is growing to appoint him as our official leader, and all that remains is to make an official declaration."
 SPA_regional_agrarian_commissions: "Regional Agrarian Commissions"
 SPA_regional_agrarian_commissions_desc: "The countryside has been ravaged by the war. To ensure the populace does not starve, we will establish agrarian commissions for each region, with immediate effect. These will maximize productivity of the undamaged arable land and enable us to feed the people."
 SPA_adopt_the_26_points: "Adopt the 26 Points"
 SPA_adopt_the_26_points_desc: "Having conveniently removed the stipulation against the merger of political parties from the Falange's \"27 Points\", the resulting \"26 Points\" makes for a good party manifesto that we can borrow from for inspiration on government policies."
 SPA_embrace_the_spanish_destiny: "Embrace the Spanish Destiny"
 SPA_embrace_the_spanish_destiny_desc: "Spain awaits a singular destiny: give all Spaniards the freedom to belong to a strong and free nation; to re-assume our pre-eminent position in the world over the objections of our enemies; and to defend the Christian way of life."
 SPA_jan: "Rally the JAN"
 SPA_jan_desc: "The Juventudes de Acción Nacional are the youth wing of our party and have captured the boundless energy hidden within the Spanish youth, which is far different to the desolate and enervating scepticism of our defeatists and intellectuals. The JAN faithfully came to the aid of Spain during the civil war by recruiting many volunteers for our holy cause. Now that the war is over, the JAN should be expanded and provide a home for all of our society's young."
 SPA_national_revolution: "National Revolution"
 SPA_national_revolution_desc: "The Patriotic Union will bring forth a new order, sweeping away any vestiges of previous failed regimes. To implement it necessitates a national revolution with direct, fiery and combative action. Life is a militia and must be lived with a pure spirit of service and sacrifice in order to regenerate the damaged Spanish nation."
 SPA_the_national_syndicalist_state: "The National-Syndicalist State"
 SPA_the_national_syndicalist_state_desc: "The civil war is over, and the time has come for the temporary military government to relinquish control and for the true leaders of the Falange to step up and usher in the new era for Spain."
 SPA_spanish_man: "The New Spanish Man"
 SPA_spanish_man_desc: "The anarchic generation of 98 and their ideas have created a sad, harsh and vinegary Spanish youth. We shall forge new men: an authentic, happy, optimistic, Spanish youth unlike the current that is riddled with defeatism and lacking in vision."
 SPA_suspend_the_constitution: "Suspend the Constitution"
 SPA_suspend_the_constitution_desc: "We will make no progress as long as we adhere to a constitution that has repeatedly proven its fallibility and weakness. We will suspend it, paving the way for a military transitional government that may guide us through this necessary fratricide, which in turn will eventually make way for a new, strong, authoritarian government."
 SPA_abolish_parties: "Corporatise the Cortes"
 SPA_abolish_parties_desc: "Following a corporate model, the Cortes will be closed, with the National Consultative Assembly standing in their place. A fruitful evolutionary process will begin that will allow the transformation of national public life, creating a corporate and authoritarian State. The parliamentary system in its current form is a failure, and so a Supreme National Assembly is required to build a New Spain."
 SPA_arrest_leaders: "Arrest the Malcontents"
 SPA_arrest_leaders_desc: "We will never have true peace while radicals are free to foment discord. While they will certainly do their best to rise up, their time is done and they know it. We must capture the worst of the leaders and put them away - this is the path to lasting unity for Spain."
 SPA_banish_the_party_leaders: "Banish the Party Leaders"
 SPA_banish_the_party_leaders_desc: "The individual party leadership of the Falange and the Carlists are increasingly trying to push their own agendas, proving to be a thorn in our side. By exploiting their disunity to undermine their position, we can justify banishing these recalcitrant leaders from the country, replacing them with puppets loyal to Franco."
 SPA_fuse_the_parties: "Fuse the Parties"
 SPA_fuse_the_parties_desc: "The necessary groundwork has been laid, and the time has come to unify the Falange and the Carlists into a single party, headed by Francisco Franco."
 SPA_dictator_for_life: "Dictator for Life"
 SPA_dictator_for_life_desc: "Franco has served his nation well. We see no need to change this state of affairs, and certainly not to return to the weak monarchy of old."
 SPA_la_division_azul: "La División Azul"
 SPA_la_division_azul_desc: "Though we have vanquished the Communist threat here in Iberia, the root of evil still looms in the East. While others bear the brunt of the fighting, we should send a division of volunteers to do our part in combating this threat."
 SPA_syndicalize_production: "Syndicalize Production"
 SPA_syndicalize_production_desc: "Our movement sets itself apart from both capitalism and communism. Instead, we will create national syndicates where employees and employers can work together to maximize productivity for the betterment of all of Spain."
 SPA_establish_the_directory: "Establish the Directory"
 SPA_establish_the_directory_desc: "Emilio Mola, grand architect of the uprising, has obtained sufficient support from the Junta and the Falange's political leaders to begin the next stage of his plan: the establishment of a Directory which will manage all aspects of the civil war until such a time that the country has been secured."
 SPA_a_one_party_state: "A One-Party State"
 SPA_a_one_party_state_desc: "Democracy, rather than an end unto itself, as the Republicans would have us believe, is in fact naught but a means to wrest full control of the state from the weak and unworthy. We will do away with all other political parties, so that those with a strong vision will not be hindered in their pursuit for a Great Spain."
 SPA_strengthen_the_supreme_reality_of_spain: "Strengthen the Supreme Reality of Spain"
 SPA_strengthen_the_supreme_reality_of_spain_desc: "For too long has separatism, dissent, and local autonomy weakened the Spanish state. We will do away with these silly notions, and present a new reality for a unified Spain that all, no matter their group or class, can relate and contribute to."
 SPA_the_phalanx_ascendant: "The Phalanx Ascendant"
 SPA_the_phalanx_ascendant_desc: "The rise of the Falange is now. The defunct Republic is in its death throes, and though the fight will be long and hard, we have taken the first steps on the path to the rebirth of the Spanish Empire."
 SPA_rebuild_command: "Rebuild Our National Command"

 SPA_modern_terrico: "Reorganise the Infantry"
 SPA_modern_terrico_desc: "While armoured warfare has its place, the backbone of every major army will always remain the humble footsoldier. Our infantry brigades will be reorganised and modernised into an elite fighting force, able to see off anyone who dares to challenge it."
 SPA_preservation_of_order: "Preservation of Order"
 SPA_preservation_of_order_desc: "A loyal army is fundamental to maintaining order in the state. Without one, anarchy and chaos is sure to prevail against order, and so we must therefore take steps to ensure and encourage loyalty in the army."
 SPA_artillery_effort: "Modern Guns for Modern Soldiers"
 SPA_artillery_effort_desc: "The world is quickly moving past the age of bolt action and small capacity semi-automatic rifles, and yet many of our frontline infantry are still equipped with this old fashioned equipment. If we are to be victorious we must focus on modernising and updating our infantry equipment and artillery, lest we wish for our army to languish in the past forever."
 SPA_guardia_civil: "Guardia Civil"
 SPA_guardia_civil_desc: "The Guardia Civil is the gendarme of the Spanish government and it has a military role in protecting the country. We should strengthen the Guardia Civil and provide them with better military training to be one of the backbones of the new Spanish army."
 SPA_emergency_factories: "Emergency Armament Production"
 SPA_emergency_factories_desc: "In times of peace we can afford to enforce safety standards and protections in our factories, but we no longer have this luxury. While some of those working in our factories may be injured, or potentially give their lives in service of the cause, it is a sacrifice we have to endure."
 SPA_prepare_for_the_next_war: "Prepare For The Next War"
 SPA_prepare_for_the_next_war_desc: "Now that our war is coming to an end, we must focus on the success of our next campaigns. Especially sincem with diplomatic relations broken down all over Europe, it will be impossible for us to remain neutral without having to defend ourselves."

 SPA_fuel_for_the_war_machine_desc: "Resources are of paramount importance to our war industry, and the more self-sufficient we can be in these needs, the better.

 SPA_reprofessionalize_the_military: "Reprofessionalize The Military"
 SPA_reprofessionalize_the_military_desc: "By necessity our army has been rebuilt from those who were not educated in the strict discipline of military life.

 SPA_army_of_maneuver: "Army of Manoeuvre"
 SPA_army_of_maneuver_desc: "It is no longer the Weltkrieg, wars cannot be easily won by simply having a large cannon. Motorised divisions, tank brigades, and fast moving infantry are key to victory, and so they will be key to the armies of Spain."
 SPA_mechanized_effort: "Spanish Auto Industry"

 SPA_navarran_lancers_desc: "During the first Carlist War, the lancers from Navarra were some of the best cavalry troops that the armies had. It therefore seems fitting to revive this legacy with our tank brigades. They shall be our elite troops, and the tip of the spear of the Spanish Army."
 SPA_tank_shipments: "Request French Tank Shipments"
 SPA_tank_shipments_desc: "If we are to win this ongoing war, we will need as many tanks as possible deployed to the battlefield.

By petitioning Berlin, we may be able to quickly get a sizable amount of these tanks delivered, allowing us to quickly send them to the frontlines."
 SPA_a_modern_army: "A Modern Army"
 SPA_a_modern_army_desc: "It was not long ago that our army was hopelessly outdated, barely advancing since the Napoleonic Wars.

 SPA_defend_the_coast_desc: "The Spanish Navy shall focus on defending Spain itself. While it shall not be as large as some want, it will be respected and it shall defend Spain from all enemies."
 SPA_coast_guard: "Establish a Dedicated Coast Guard"
 SPA_coast_guard_desc: "Currently Spain lacks any form of dedicated coast guard force, with most of the duties being handled by the Guardia Civil until recently. If we are to fully protect the Spanish coast from any possible threats, it would be imperative for us to establish a dedicated coast guard unit to handle these duties instead."
 SPA_cruiser_support: "Light Cruiser Support"
 SPA_cruiser_support_desc: "The use of smaller, more lightly armoured scout ships will allow us to disperse forces across a wide area in order to scout our entire coastline, ensuring we are able to rapidly respond to enemy incursions."
 SPA_protect_our_colonies: "Protect Our Colonies"
 SPA_protect_our_colonies_desc: "The overseas colonies that we still hold are of vital interest to Spain and we should use our navy to protect the coast of our colonies from all attackers. However in case that is not viable, several well placed coastal forts and batteries shall do the job."

 SPA_academia_basica_del_aire: "Academia Básica del Aire"
 SPA_academia_basica_del_aire_desc: "Modern wars are fought not only on the land and across the seas, but also in the skies. Modern air doctrines must be instilled into our pilots, and state of the art planes must be built if we expect to be victorious in our battles."
 SPA_new_pilots: "Training New Pilots"
 SPA_new_pilots_desc: "Most of our current air force is made up of eager volunteers and former pilots of civilian aircraft, with little to no knowledge of military aviation. It is therefore imperative that these recruits receive proper training before they are deployed in the skies, as their experience will hopefully give us the edge we need over our rivals."
 SPA_paratrooper_focus: "Desperta Ferro!"
 SPA_paratrooper_focus_desc: "By the end of the Middle Ages, a famous company of Aragonese mercenaries, the Almogávares, made their war cry “Awake the Iron” famous across the Mediterranean.

 SPA_aviation_industry: "Support the Aviation Industry"

 SPA_upgrade_air_ports_desc: "The infrastructure needed to support a large air force does not need to be built completely from the ground up.

 SPA_army_air_support: "Army Air Support"
 SPA_army_air_support_desc: "The easiest enemy to fight is one who has already been killed by a bombing run before the battle begins, and so our air force should be focused on producing planes focused on battlefield support missions and bombing efforts to support our troops in their endeavours."
 SPA_bombers: "Bomber Effort"

 SPA_foreign_airplanes: "Purchase Foreign Planes"
 SPA_foreign_airplanes_desc: "Our country is not really in the position to manufacture an air force. For this reason, we must purchase old planes from abroad to help kickstart the Spanish Air Force. The air war is likely to become of greater importance as the Weltkrieg had suggested decades ago."
 SPA_voice_of_heaven: "Eyes of Heaven"
 SPA_voice_of_heaven_desc: "Radar is a promising new technology which, with further development could provide a wealth of information about enemy tactics and positions and reveal the course of enemy aircraft.

The question of if and how we should return the industry to the original owners after this period of nationalisation is simply one for a future time, preferably far enough that it no longer matters."
 SPA_military_factories: "Expand the Arms Industry"
 SPA_military_factories_desc: "War will likely come to Spain in the future. The godless Commune of France sits just across the Pyrenees after all. Thus in order to prepare for that future war, we should build new military factories."
 SPA_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
 SPA_modern_agriculture_desc: "The many small farm estates of the countryside have struggled during the recent troubles we have faced, as they have been unable to adopt new agricultural technologies and methods of cultivation.

 SPA_catholic_trade_unions_desc: "Trade unions are unfortunately rather important in the modern economy, and we cannot simply get rid of them completely.

 SPA_increased_volunteers: "Unofficial Intervention"
 SPA_increased_volunteers_desc: "Just because we are officially neutral, it does not mean that our private citizens must also be neutral. Many in our country still wish to fight in conflicts overseas, and it would be wrong to stop them from doing so.

 SPA_influx_of_refugees: "Influx of Refugees"
 SPA_influx_of_refugees_desc: "Being a neutral country in Europe during this great war has resulted in an influx of refugees fleeing their homes and arriving in Spain to be free of conflict.

 SPA_lease_gibraltar: "Lease Gibraltar"
 SPA_lease_gibraltar_desc: "While we may officially be neutral in the ongoing conflict between French and its Syndicalist rivals, it does not mean we do not wish for a French victory over the godless socialists.

 SPA_french_mining_projects: " French Mining Projects"
 SPA_french_mining_projects_desc: "The French war machine never ceases its thirst for more resources to produce further armaments.
