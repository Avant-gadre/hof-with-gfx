  SOV_Tactical_Air_Force_desc: "The Air Force should "lay hands" for the Army in the overall strategy. Fighters seize the frontline air superiority so that the attack aircraft can reap the enemy's land units at ease. Therefore, we need to build more of these two types of aircraft. "

  SOV_Assault_Engineer_desc: "The evolution of weapons of war has not completely lost the value of infantry. In particular, infantry still has an irreplaceable role in urban fortified battles.

  SOV_Militarization_of_labor_idea_desc: "The benefits of militarization of labor are not only reflected in the effective supervision of workers, but also the people in Russia who are best at using precision equipment. More workers and soldiers means higher overall quality of the Red Army. "
  SOV_Cut_bureaucracy: "Cut off the Bureaucracy "
  SOV_Cut_bureaucracy_desc: "The returning Trotsky hated the bureaucratic system built by Dzhugashvili, so when he returned, many bureaucrats had already ran away from the office with boxes. This saved a lot of effort for streamlining the organization. Many organizations with more than a dozen people were quickly simplified to fewer than ten office staff, which would ensure that General Secretary Trotsky always communicated with the people.

  SOV_Farmer_problem: "Collectivization Problem"
  SOV_Farmer_problem_desc: "Trotsky was in favor of collectivization, but most of the peasants who did not care about politics were expecting the new general secretary to completely abolish this exploitative policy.

A great military victory, he is the real Napoleon, and he will surpass Napoleon, because the Soviets will surely win the final victory! "

  SOV_Return_of_exile_desc: "Tukhachevsky did not decide to become a military dictator, but he decided to invite Trotsky, who was in exile, to return to direct the Soviets. After all, after all the Dzhugashvili factions were completely wiped out, the regime had already seen a ideological vacuum. Obviously, the world revolution can replace the theory of building socialism in one country as the new guiding ideology at this time. "

 more_soviet_dlc.1.d: "Many people think that Khrushchev is a cunning party stick, and it is incredible that this plain, unassuming man with no background can now turn into a favorite of Dzhugashvili. \n\nIn the "Yagoda anti-Soviet case" two years ago, a large number of Ukrainian regional party officials were arrested, and Khrushchev, who relied on the recommendation of another close vassal of Dzhugashvili, Kaganovich, logically took office and became the head of the Ukrainian side, and rightly implemented the resolution to establish an autonomous council in Ukraine, and from So far he has done a very good job, and the new wave of resistance around Ukraine is subsiding. \n\n Dzhugashvili called back such a loyal and capable person naturally not arrested and imprisoned, Khrushchev should have been promoted to a higher position as his close minister to fill the power vacuum after the purge, and the latter has long known about the upcoming arrests and his own promotion, but he does not seem to feel comfortable about it, and recently there has been something weighing on the mind of this local official."

 more_soviet_dlc.2.d: "A few weeks ago at his heavily secured private residence, Khrushchev read an anonymous letter that had somehow been dropped in with a few and clear messages \n\n"§RDzhugashvili wants you dead! §!" \n\nThis is nonsense. Maybe it's some kind of a diversionary scheme of the Ukrainian rebels... It's ridiculous that they are still doing this kind of stuff. \n\nBut... Is it really nonsense? Khrushchev still has some connections in Moscow, it seems that a few guys "disappeared", such as the left-wing opposition Sh... Shlyapnikov, that guy really does not know where to go! \n\nKhrushchev happens to have had a little relationship with Trotsky, since the defeat of Trotsky in the internal struggle after exile abroad Khrushchev has been in varying degrees of anxiety, the thought of their own hard work in Ukraine to maintain stability and suppression but also sent by Dzhugashvili what the bastard director of the political department Mekhlis to stare at is weak and more annoyed, afraid that this hateful lick dog one day caught what The handle reported up and then removed from office to investigate and deal with nothing. It is difficult not to be in the limelight now Dzhugashvili really want to kill all the people who once now and in the future may oppose him?"
 more_soviet_dlc.2.a: ""Seriously, he could really do something like that... Hmm? Why stop? You guys .... Who are you guys?!!!""  
 more_soviet_dlc.3.t: "Cunning Khrushchev"
 more_soviet_dlc.3.d: "In fact Khrushchev is a cunning party stick, and according to his own words, it is cunning that has to be faced with the cruel tyrant Joseph I. If he really intends to end everything one day, then Khrushchev, who has the misfortune to be the one to end it, will resist with all his might! \n\nWhether or not Dzhugashvili intends to take advantage of the meeting in Moscow to eliminate everyone, Khrushchev knows that the only way to save his life and take down his former boss is to create a chaos and unite more people, holding the military power of the commander-in-chief of the Red Army Tukhachevsky and Dzhugashvili's centrifugal tendencies are the most serious, this person on the face of the saints are in a special armed train escorted by his own soldiers, if you can get his If we can get his military support to come to a successful Kornilov coup is not impossible."

 more_soviet_dlc.4.d: ""Look! Look at this! What have you done? What have you done? What! What!!!" Inside the Kremlin, the austere office of the General Secretary was filled with smoke, and Dzhugashvili took a puff of his pipe, and his face was suddenly bruised and fierce, grabbed the half-smoked pipe and smashed it hard on the floor and rolled it to Yezhov's shoes. \n\n "Sorry General Secretary, when my men arrived at the Ukrainian military district command really did not see a single person, Yakir and Primakov with the entire staff squad all ... disappeared." Even the Minister of Internal Affairs, who was a man above all others, and who was the source of his own power, and who had terrorized the Russian lands, was only submissive to the lecture. \n\n "Do I need you to repeat it?! All you have to do now is to find these two bastards and shoot them immediately, by any means!" Dzhugashvili ranted as he returned to his desk, calmly picking up the cold coffee and taking a gentle sip, Yezhov knew that now he should not remain here."
 more_soviet_dlc.4.a: ""Click!" (closing the door)"   
 more_soviet_dlc.5.t: "Suggestions"
 more_soviet_dlc.5.d: ""Are you serious? Boris?" \n\n "Don't look at me like that, Nikolai, I never joke with you in this respect." The man addressed as Boris did not look as difficult as Yezhov, but rather looked cold, in contrast to the weathered man who looked more like the Minister of Internal Affairs. "Dzhugashvili should have lost confidence in you, after the stimulus of the coup attempt he must be thinking of strengthening the power of the General Secretary, and you in this critical moment even missed a military district commander and a military commander level in Ukraine?G not to mention that those two people also shake your face abroad, what would you think if you were Dzhugashvili? " \n\n "Then what can I do? Are you not clear? Everything I have is given to me by him, I can only do my duty to complete his task, he can make me gain everything or easily make me lose everything ah!" \n\n "So why do you keep thinking in this way?" Boris scratched his bald head rather helplessly. "Isn't a revolution about fighting for your destiny?" \n\n "Then... What am I going to do then?" Yezhov likewise took off his blue hat, topped with a mess of greasy hair full of sadness simply do not know what the future holds. \n\n "Do I need to teach you this kind of thing? You have forgotten how to kill people with your own hands?""
 more_soviet_dlc.5.a: ""Uh... I actually... Haven't killed anyone.""    
 more_soviet_dlc.5.b: ""You wouldn't want me to...""     
 more_soviet_dlc.6.t: "Terror in the dark"
 more_soviet_dlc.6.d: "At three o'clock in the morning, Dzhugashvili strolled down the dimly lit Kremlin corridor and turned a corner to reach the bedroom, the spacious room with nothing opulent or elegantly decorated, a bed sufficient to eliminate the restlessness caused by the frequent events of the past few days. \n\n "Hard work... It's time for you guys to change shifts, right?" Passing by the soldiers standing guard, Dzhugashvili suddenly stretched out a long yawn and dropped his raised hands to pat him hard on the shoulder. In the face of the General Secretary's sudden care, the young soldier instinctively looked nervous and could not speak his legs trembled, even though as a chamberlain he did not know about the Khrushchev-Tukhachevsky case, the stern atmosphere that enveloped the entire Kremlin had long cursed everyone here. \n\n Dzhugashvili was obviously not very satisfied with the soldier's hasty performance, but he did not say anything, once again resumed his gloomy look and walked straight away, completely unaware of another soldier's all wrong look. Just see the head wrinkles highlight the "young soldier" from the arms of a "barrel" very long pistol, [ENG.GetName] manufactured silencer enough to make the sound of assassination is limited to this corridor, and just tapped on the shoulder of the soldier also Will not stop ---- he was originally Yezhov planted in the Kremlin informants! \n\nPerhaps Boris was a little rusty, raising his rifle to aim when the rifle on his back a shaking, sensing the difference Dzhugashvili turned around, wide-eyed just to call for help but fell down in three muffled sounds, and Boris did not stop there, continued to aim at the head of Dzhugashvili in a pool of blood shot all the remaining three rounds of ammunition. \n\n "Comrade Dzerzhinsky, is it all over?" The inside man who watched the whole process held his breath and turned pale, he did not want to do such a thing, but Yezhov's group had long seized his "political mistakes" as a handle, but those so-called handles can really blackmail themselves to this point? It should not be so... \n\n "Don't ask irrelevant questions, do as I say next, you go first to wrap up the body." Boris, of course, perceived the hostility of his accomplice, this kind of people in the past but see a lot, hurry to give an order to let him have something to do will not have to be confused."
 more_soviet_dlc.6.a: ""Of course, the real last step is actually... Somebody! There are assassins!!!""    
 more_soviet_dlc.7.t: ""Congratulations! Comrade Acting General Secretary.""

Bukharin naturally attracted many supporters because of the success of the NEP, but Anna Morozova, as an orthodox Marxist-Leninist theorist and a central figure in the party, was also very popular. Despite the fact that the first elections tended to go to the party's prestigious top brass, Sonia Zima, the leader of Komsomol, also stood for election and won the support of many party members with her excellent oratory skills.

And when Dzhugashvili intended to abandon Yezhov, "Dzerzhinsky" also boldly advised -- to kill Dzhugashvili. \n\nHe originally wanted to help the comrades in the Far East to defeat the red bandits in his own way, but they are really not useful.

He had thrown bombs at the Tsar's executioners, he had participated in the suppression of the Bolsheviks who now bowed to him, he had "gone undercover" in his own way in the NKVD......, which he had hated and was now too frantic to leave. Does he still have loyalty? Is there still a trace of his life? He wanted to find someone to talk to, but no one could listen to his story. \n\nHe works in the building of NKVD in Lubyanka, sometimes like a decent "people's politician", sometimes like a nervous patient, which causes a lot of problems for the "blue hats" around him. But today, it was not a "blue hat" who came to his office, but an acquaintance, a person who could make the heart of the man whose soul had been swallowed up in a huge wave. \n\n"Comrade Zaychik, please sit down, would you like a drink?" Savinkov greeted the shadows behind the pillar. The young girl in the shadow finally appeared, her legs had been replaced with prosthetic limbs, while her right arm had been dripping blood. "Boris, you have a peculiar way of treating guests. But then again, I didn't expect us to meet here myself." \n\nBronya Zaychik walked in, her blue gown neat, except for the fact that her right arm had been soaked in blood. "Alexander Kerensky, Viktor Chernov and Kadoc Zempulus, and even Józef Piłsudski, they all thought you were dead. To be honest, I just think you're still alive. When I get back, Kerensky is going to give me 50. I send you my regards for several of the aforementioned associates." As usual, Bronya spoke lightly of her feelings in a flat tone of little emotion. Savinkov's mouth twitched and he said provocatively, "You couldn't leave this building even if you killed me here. What about the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which has been destroyed by its own weakness and stupidity? People like you, who still have blood in their veins, will not change anything in the end." With that, he went to get red wine from the special wine cabinet of the NKVD. "Hum, no need," sneered Bronya. "I just came to say hello to an old comrade"\n\nBronya stood up from the armchair, and Savinkov reacted very quickly and hit her in the chest with a pistol that had long been clutched in his hand. Bronya fell in a pool of blood, her left hand still squeezing her already loaded pistol. "I should have known I should have practiced more with my left hand ......", she thought to herself. Her life skipped before her eyes like a walking light, the farm in the Urals, her experience as a doll soldier, the assassination of a Tsarist officer, her allegiance under Savinkov, the establishment of a small branch of the Socialist Revolutionary Party in the civil war ...... She had promised not to engage in assassinations again, but today blood still stained the building in Lubyanka. After all the years she fought, that farm in the Urals may have finally become rich, or it may have become worse again. She, on the other hand, will always be just an orphan on that farm that no one remembers."

  soviet_flavour.1.t: "Five-Year Plan and factional disputes within the party"
  soviet_flavour.1.d: "Lenin, the mentor who founded the Bolsheviks and the great Soviet Socialist Union, had been pursuing the "New Economic Policy" before his death. This was a correction of the cruel but necessary "Military Communism" policy during the first Russian Civil War. Before his death, Lenin warned that the alliance between the proletariat of this country and the poor and middle peasants must be maintained to ensure that the White Army can be defeated in the end. After the war, Dzhugashvili and Bukharin formed an alliance to continue to support the "New Economic Policy." At the same time, some small capitalist economies were acquiesced to develop within the country, which even attracted some secret investments from European and American capitalist countries. But Bukharin's slogan of "make the peasants rich" severely dampened the opposition of the left-wing opposition in the party, such as Trotsky and Shlyapnikov. Trotsky insisted that "abandoning the principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat" in order to compete with the White Army for the support of the peasants would eventually lead to the destruction of the proletarian power and the restoration of capitalism. Trotsky's ally Preobrazhensky believed that the development of socialism required the proletariat to complete the capital accumulation of capitalist countries through colonial exploitation, and therefore advocated "exploiting" products forcibly from the peasants through the "five-year plan” and develop heavy industry to ensure the stable rule of the proletariat. In order to consolidate "party unity" and suppress "sectarianism", Dzhugashvili, Bukharin and Anna Morozova formed a "three-head alliance" to maintain the development of the new economic policy. \n\nUnfortunately, the good times of the "New Economic Policy" did not last long. As the policies regarding the status of farmers and the limits of free trade in agricultural products were in a state of vagueness, agricultural development has not been able to meet the needs of urban development of socialist industry. On the other hand, due to the shortage of industrial products and consumer goods, some farmers who have become rich are unwilling to sell grain because they have nothing to buy, and farmers who have not yet become rich have nothing to sell. Therefore, in this case, even Bukharin chose to support the use of more "tough" means to purchase grain from farmers. Dzhugashvili, who was inserting his own eye in the party, increasingly emphasized the danger of the "rich peasants" and the urgency of class struggle, but it was not until Trotsky's dispute over "world revolution or socialism in one country" And Preobrazhensky expelled from the party, Dzhugashvili continued to hide behind Bukharin to support the new economic policy. \n\nHowever, in 1928, when the white bandits were in a mess due to the restoration of the monarchy, Dzhugashvili suddenly changed his usual arguments and almost completely accepted Preobrazhensky's The theory states that "the time has come" for the collectivization of Russia. So Bukharin, Rykov and others instantly became "rightists", while Anna Morozova wisely chose to be silent, but insisted without pain that "the economic policy must be discussed in a historical materialist way." Because Dzhugashvili had already planted a large number of party members in the party before, the struggle ended in Dzhugashvili's complete victory. Bukharin, Likov and others were quickly marginalized, and the "three-headed alliance" was declared disintegrated. As a result, the five-year plan began vigorously before the civil war was won. "

  soviet_flavour.2.t: "The failed five-year plan"
  soviet_flavour.2.d: "Dzhugashvili's five-year plan was not as smooth as he thought. In order to compromise with the right-wing opposition, Dzhugashvili used tax and price control in the early days, as well as "limited" coercive measures. However, The only result is a decline in the amount of food purchased, and it is foreseeable that it will continue to decline in the future. After all the economic proposals in the party have been tried, it seems that there is no other means: Either thoroughly promote compulsory collectivization and compulsory expropriation of agricultural products; or completely return to the early new economic policies and open up free trade in agricultural products. Dzhugashvili chose the former, and in the internal meeting of the Supreme Soviet "democratically" passed the decision to complete the collectivization through the supervision of the NKVD and eliminate the "rich peasants" class. The consequences of this decision were devastating. Peasants wantonly destroyed food and slaughtered livestock, so Dzhugashvili suspended these policies and secretly instructed Anna Morozova to publish the editorial "Victory Dazzling", criticizing Kaganovich and NKVD Minister Yagoda, who were in charge of this matter, "have acted too hastily" and violated the "principle of voluntariness". As a result, NKVD and officials at all levels hesitated, and a large number of collective farms were disbanded. \n\nAt this time, Dzhugashvili had no other choice but to implement thorough police measures, so he gave Yagoda a death order to "use all means" to compel collectivization. The resistance to collectivization was particularly strong in Ukraine, so Dzhugashvili sent Tukhachevsky to Ukraine to "help guarantee collectivization". As a result, many officers had forged animosity with the Ukrainians during the first civil war. Regarding the collective as an opportunity for revenge, the peasants were categorized as "rich peasants", deprived of their property and invested in collective farms with poor conditions, or exiled to the Caucasus. When Dzhugashvili ordered Tukhachevsky to suppress a "counter-revolutionary rebellion" in western Ukraine, Tukhachevsky, who had stubbornly suppressed the Tambov uprising, chose to treat it negatively and acted against the order. And Yagoda did not intend to completely obey Dzhugashvili's orders, so he began to deliberately or unintentionally falsely report the progress of the mission. \n\nCollectivization is at a deadlock again, and the entire Bolshevik Party is like a centipede that is dying but struggling, unable to push collectivization further. In order to ease the situation in Ukraine, Dzhugashvili reluctantly agreed to Anna Morozova's proposal to establish the Ukrainian Autonomous Committee, but he knew that he had to do something. "

  soviet_flavour.3.t: "Five-Year Plan and Population Estimation "
  soviet_flavour.3.d: "Lenin's sudden death in 1925 did not hinder the continuation of the New Economic Policy. The temporary ceasefire with the White Army in 1926 gave the Soviet regime a respite. Under the guidance of the famous statistician N.D. Kondratiev, the nascent Soviet regime completed a census of the liberated areas. This census shows that the entire Soviet Union has a population of about 130 million excluding the Central-Eastern Siberia occupied by the White Army. After the end of the New Economic Policy and collectivization During the period, the top leaders in the party, especially Dzhugashvili himself, were full of confidence in the population growth of the Soviet Union. In a meeting with the representatives of the collective farm, he mentioned: "Everyone said that the material state of the workers was dramatic improved, life becomes better and more interesting. This is of course true. This also makes the population multiply faster than in the past. Fertility rates have increased, mortality rates have decreased, and overall population growth has grown stronger. This is of course a good thing and we welcome it. Now our annual net population growth is 3 million. This means that each of our five-year plans will increase the population of an entire area occupied by the white bandits. "\n\nThe plan for the second census was put on the agenda when the "successful" five-year plan was deemed to be almost completed. On May 15, 1932, the Statistical Commission of the Soviet State Planning Commission formally established a special agency for the census , Under the chairmanship of Valerian Osinsky. On April 22, 1932, the People's Committee of the Soviet Union passed a resolution to implement the 1933 All-Union Census. However, the implementation date of the census has been postponed. Of course, Dzhugashvili has ample reason to stop this census, because the White Army has recently begun to show new trends. If the final victory of the Revolutionary War is in sight, then it is meaningless to start the census before the second civil war. So Dzhugashvili's confidence in the population growth of the Soviet Union became a generally optimistic estimate of the population of the entire Union. "

However, the results of the census were beyond everyone's expectations: the population of the entire Union turned out to be only 162 million people! This is a total difference of 3 million from Dzhugashvili's claim of 165 million in 1935, which according to experts from the Soviet People's Committee was estimated by the natural growth rate of population and economic conditions in 1926. What's more deadly is that the population of Ukraine has even decreased by 500,000 compared with 1926. Although the cruel Second Civil War can partly explain the lack of population, it is important to know that the White Army and the Ukrainian rebels mobilized only 500,000 troops. \n\n[SOV.GetName] understood the problem as soon as he saw the report, he had learned the fragmentary news about the lack of food and starvation in the collectivization through multiple channels.

Although the cruel Second Civil War can partly explain the lack of population, it is important to know that the White Army and the Ukrainian rebels mobilized only 500,000 troops. \n\nAfter this result was reported to [SOV.GetName] and the Soviet People's Committee, the senior officials were shocked. Subsequently, Pravda published an article in the name of Anna Morozova, stating that "The Enemy of the People gave wrong instructions to census takers, resulting in a large-scale underestimation of the population. However, under the leadership of the great leader [SOV.GetName] , The NKVD eliminated these venomous snakes' nests in the statistical agency." Subsequently, Obolensky, Kravar and others who were in charge of the census were quickly arrested and imprisoned. Most of the statistics were destroyed or classified as confidential in Moscow and the capitals of the participating republics. Soon, the heads and heads of statistical committees in various places were also arrested and imprisoned, and discussing the census became a domestic taboo. The People's Committee promised to the public that it will conduct a real census that is "free from interference by the people's enemies" in two years. "

  soviet_flavour.6.t: "Cancelled Census"
  soviet_flavour.6.d: "With the defeat of the White Army and the unification of Russia, the second census can finally begin. While the Soviet State Planning Commission was trying to postpone the census, Marshal [SOV.GetLeader] said that "there is no need to conduct a census." The Marshal's decision was probably because the Marshal did not trust other bureaucrats outside the Red Army system, or because he disliked this "meaningless literary doctrine." Indeed, the position of the General Staff in the Marshal's mind is much higher than that of the State Planning Commission. But there are also rumors that the Marshal learned something that politicians in the office of the Soviet People's Committee could not know during the suppression of the rebellion in Ukraine, which convinced him that not conducting the census was the best choice. Perhaps the census, as a tool of economic planning, will disappear forever in the Soviet Union. \n\nBut so what? The great Soviet people will not stick to such trivial matters. Subsequently, Pravda published an article in the name of Anna Morozova, saying that "the census is only an attempt in the period of socialist exploration. In a truly socialist country, the census is unnecessary. In other words, a country under the dictatorship of the proletariat does not need to divide the people into different groups and types through the census. The census is essentially against Marxism." The 1926 census may become Russia. This is the last census in history. "

  soviet_flavour.7.t: "Linguistic Controversy"
  soviet_flavour.7.d: "Nikolai Yakovlevich Marr is a well-known linguist from Georgia. His theory has made a great contribution to the Latinization of the languages of the Caucasian ethnic minorities, and then to open up the exchanges of the various ethnic groups in the Caucasus. In fact, a lot of the large-scale white bandits in the Caucasus and the rebellion instigated by international imperialism during the civil war are due to him. Recently, Professor Marx tried to construct a Marxist language system, using Marxist methods to explore the birth, evolution and development of language. Recently, "Pravda" published Professor Marr's monograph "On the Historical Materialism Theory of Linguistics". This paper puts forward an important point, that is, language is an ideology, a superstructure, and a part of the class system. The development of language corresponds to the stage of social development of social development. The traditional linguistic doctrine that divides languages into regions is regarded by Marr as a mechanical and metaphysical science of capitalism. Marr believes that the evolution of language takes the form of a "qualitative leap", which corresponds to the qualitative change of society. For example, in primitive society, humans use gesture language, which corresponds to the classless situation in primitive society. Oral language is a characteristic of class society. In the future proletarian society, just as the country will disappear, the language that hinders human communication will also disappear. The proletariat will use "thinking language" to replace the current spoken language, in other words, just as the country will die, the language will die. \n\nSoon, Marr's linguistic theory automatically became the authority of the entire linguistics circle and was regarded as the only progressive theory. In this case, Anna Morozova also published an article in Pravda, praising Professor Marr for "revealing the historical materialist laws of language development in an amazing way". She claimed that this theory liberated the proletariat from "oppressive language systems and language barriers that hindered the unity of the proletariat." An action critical of capitalist linguistics has been launched vigorously under the advocacy of Marr."

  soviet_flavour.8.t: "Linguistic Controversy"
  soviet_flavour.8.d: ""For a time, Moscow University and Leningrad University began a wave of Marxist linguistics. Some scholars have begun to study how "thinking language" works, and other scholars (mainly from historical backgrounds) have begun to study the language differences of various social classes in the Western world, especially the United States, and try to learn from English slang and written language. The difference discusses how English embodies a kind of oppressive capitalism. Some people argue that the British Communist Party should be required to change its official language to Russian, because although Russian is still a remnant of class society, it is closer to the proletarian "thinking language". This has been proved by Russia's first entry into the socialist stage. A graduate student from Moscow University questioned why Russia was lagging behind in the development of capitalism, so why the Russian language was more advanced. This led Anna Morozova to publish an article in Pravda pointing out how British imperialism was maintained by oppressing the colonies. The process of the hegemony of English as a more reactionary language was called "the linguistic application of Leninism", and the graduate student was given a warning by Moscow University. \n\nMore importantly, some linguists began to discuss a more "serious" issue, that is, whether to begin to transform the language of the entire Soviet Union. Some people think that Russian should be comprehensively promoted first, and other languages should be gradually phased out before the socialist transformation of Russian is carried out. Others believe that all languages in the alliance should be transformed in the same way, so that all languages will transition to the "language of thinking" together. Professor Marr himself did not continue to participate in these discussions. Perhaps he was not interested in these practical and subtle issues, or perhaps these discussions had exceeded his own expectations for the role of this theory. ""

  soviet_flavour.9.t: "Interrupted linguistic Controversy"
  soviet_flavour.9.d: ""[SOV.GetLeader] finally couldn't bear it, published an article in Pravda, and attached four letters to answer readers' questions. [SOV.GetLeader] severely criticized Marr's theory and pointed out that language is not a superstructure, nor is it ideological. Language belongs to the entire society, not to a certain class. Class expressions only account for a small part of all vocabulary. There is no "qualitative leap" in the development of language. It is a gradual development. Some features disappear, while others are formed. Regarding the "death of language", Marr's theory is also completely wrong. [SOV.GetLeader] pointed out that language is connected with thinking, and people use vocabulary in language to think, and thinking out of language does not exist. [SOV.GetLeader] incidentally reiterated the Marxist theory of economic foundation and superstructure-that is, first, economic foundation does not include productivity, including production relations. Second, the superstructure serves the economic foundation. [SOV.GetLeader] later condemned Marr in harsh terms for using his academic status to "undermine academic freedom" and "suppress ideas". He also euphemistically criticized Anna Morozova, who participated in this discussion, for "doing not understand but pretending to understand.""
  soviet_flavour.9.a: "[SOV.GetLeader] is the greatest linguist"
  soviet_flavour.10.t: "Transform the language"
  soviet_flavour.10.d: ""Now that language has been proven to be an ideology of class society, to exclude the remnants of capitalism and feudal despotism from this country, we must begin to transform our language. General Secretary Ye Ruof agreed with some linguists, that is, language as a superstructure can also be progressive and reactionary. Under the arrangement of General Secretary Yezhov, Anna Morozova published an article in Pravda to further explain her "Leninist linguistics". She believes that although the most advanced industrialized countries should have the most progressive language, the imperialist actions of the capitalist powers have largely reversed this phenomenon. This makes English, French, and German in particular one of the most reactionary languages in the world. As the weak link of imperialism, Russia has the weakest imperialist nature of language. In places that have not been affected by capitalism, or have been less affected by capitalism, language reflects the reactionary nature of feudal society. So Anna Morozova concluded that Russian is the language closest to the socialist stage. \n\nSo natural, the next step is to gradually abolish the feudal and oppressive local languages, especially Ukrainian, through the mandatory promotion of Russian throughout the alliance. Anna Morozova believes that the history of Ukrainian feudal rule and the immaturity of capitalist development make Ukrainian even more a language that strengthens the hierarchy. And Marr's students have done many studies before that show that Ukrainian and Polish have a certain affinity, and therefore have the characteristic of Polish imperialism. Therefore, gradually replacing Ukrainian with Russian in the Ukrainian region is an important step to rescue the Ukrainian people from this oppressive ideology. \n\nSecondly is the transformation of Russian. Anna Morozova believes that to transition to the proletarian "thinking language", the Russian dictionary should be gradually streamlined, and the oppressive words should be gradually removed from the dictionary. Deleted. And words that are of great significance to socialist construction should be temporarily added to the dictionary to accelerate the proletarianization of the language. Anna Morozova also excerpted several classic speeches from the quotations of General Secretary Yezhov as a model of "the most advanced language".""

  soviet_flavour.11.t: "Torgsins"
  soviet_flavour.11.d: "The implementation of the five-year plan requires a large amount of machinery and equipment. In addition to harvesting grain from the collective farms that have not been fully completed for export in exchange for machinery and equipment imports, it also relies on the domestic gold and foreign exchange reserves. Since Petrograd's gold was transferred to Vladivostok by the White Bandits and the Czechoslovak Legion, there was not much gold left in the country. At the same time, in order to attract foreign experts to work in Moscow and Leningrad, and to provide foreign tourists with "luxury goods" for sale, the People's Committee has set up a shop in big cities that can only trade in foreign exchange and gold, which is called "Torgsin". At first, there were no shortage of daily necessities in this kind of store, and citizens were not interested in foreign guest shops. At most, they would just gather outside the tall and bright window of the store to see the excitement. \n\nEverything changed in 1934. This year, Voznesensky ordered all Torgsin to be open to the Soviet people, and allowed local people to use foreign exchange and gold to shop in Torgsin. After that, the people of the Soviet Union became the main customers of torgsins, and the appearance of the store was completely changed. The shops extend from the big city to the remote countryside, and the living materials such as flour, rye bread, sugar, etc. have swallowed the place that was originally antique and leather clothing. In the spring of 1934, there was a long line at the entrance of a torgsin in Kiev for several weeks, day and night. Fights and fights appeared every day in order to obtain some flour in the store. At that time, the Soviet Torgsins had expanded to 1,500 and penetrated into various parts of the Soviet Union. Heirlooms, gold, and other precious metals from hungry people's homes are continuously transported to the center of the country through the capillaries of togsin, and the country uses these gold "secretly" from Western capitalist countries in exchange for the support of machines and technical experts. The price of goods in the Soviet Union is much more expensive than overseas. This is the consistent pricing strategy of foreign guest shops, and it is even more popular during the "Great Famine" period. The peculiar currency exchange rules are another secret of it. In order to resist hunger, people had to take out family heirlooms and jewelry in exchange for trivial food in togsin. The foreign guest shops won funds for overseas purchases needed for the industrialization of the Soviet Union, but the savings of the average Soviets were exhausted. During the three years from 1934 to 1936, the Soviets brought 70 tons of gold to the Torgsins. \n\nWhat's even more amazing is that sometimes togsin can also become a place for the White Army's espionage activities. White Army spies sometimes pretend to be citizens going to togsin, pretending to record the number and number of people visiting foreign guest shops while keeping accounts. With regard to the gold trading quota, the White Army statisticians in Chita used this information to speculate on the economic situation of the Soviet Union. And NKVD did not show weakness either. Sometimes NKVD will carry out raids on citizens going to foreign guest shops. If spies are caught, it will naturally be a victory for NKVD. If it's not a spy, that's okay. Under Soviet socialism, private possession of foreign exchange and gold was illegal. Therefore, NKVD sometimes undertakes the task of searching and suppressing gold, but because foreign exchange stores are significantly more efficient in "collecting gold" than NKVD, this makes NKVD always try to suppress torgsins. In this case, NKVD will confiscate the gold or the food in exchange for the citizens who were caught by mistake. The behavior of NKVD made the people tremble. They regarded the torgsin as a "mousetrap" and dared not go shopping anymore. In order to resolve doubts, officials of foreign guest shops often come forward to clarify, and also come forward to rescue customers and return confiscated properties. These stories may continue before the White Army is defeated and industrialized. "

  soviet_flavour.12.t: "Ismail Enver expresses allegiance to us"
  soviet_flavour.12.d: "Ismail Enver was once a important minister of the Ottoman Empire. Some Westerners accused him of leading the Ottoman Empire's slaughter of Armenians, but this did not prevent Karl Radek from introducing him to Trotsky in 1922. And lead him to join the Bolsheviks. Enver quickly demonstrated his strength in the first civil war, leading the Bolshevik Muslim armed forces in Central Asia to defeat the White Army entrenched in Central Asia, destroying the double oppression of the Central Asian people by the White bandits and the Orthodox Church. Central Asia was well organized under his governance and became a model area in the Bolshevik Liberation Zone in the Five-Year Plan, taking the lead in getting rid of the lack of industry in Central Asia. Although he was introduced to the party by Trotskyites, he proved his party spirit by accurately executing Dzhugashvili's orders during the Great Purge. Now whenever a new leader is born, Enver flew to Moscow as quickly as possible and submitted a "Report on the Construction of Socialism in Turkestan", ensuring his loyalty to the new leadership. Although some people accused him of "smarting the rudder", he himself claimed that his actions were all loyal to Leninism. "
