 ITA_citta_dell_aria: "Città dell'Aria"
 ITA_citta_dell_aria_desc: "Our research efforts have long been spread across many different areas around the country. This has made things quite inefficient.

 HOF_BBA_italo_ethiopian_war_events.01.desc: "Our forces are stagnating on the Abyssinian battlefield and are even being counterattacked in some areas. This \"spring offensive\" made Nero angry at the incompetence of the high command. The emperor wanted results, now, immediately, immediately. \n\nIn view of the present situation, the Emperor authorized the military to use all possible means to defeat Abyssinia, and the war must be ended quickly - at any cost."

 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.02_north.t: "The northern front is stalemated"
 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.02_north.desc: "Our forces' counterattack in northern Abyssinia has not met with the expected success. The emperor was convinced that the world not only regarded her as a laughing stock, but also laughed at the stalemate of the war. Nero began to consider whether she needed to take over the northern front herself to ensure that the troops were dispatched properly."

It seemed that Nero was convinced that the entire high command was deliberately working against her. In her mind, even the generals couldn't wait to lose the whole war."

 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.05_south.t: "The victory in southern Ethiopia"
 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.05_south.desc: "Nero was overjoyed by the progress on the southern Abyssinian front, and she praised the bravery shown by the Italian army and the sacrifices made by our troops to end this conflict. Her Majesty never had the slightest doubt that our troops were capable of victory on the battlefield - provided they were properly supported by the Emperor."

The magazine system uses en bloc charger clips which were originally developed by Ferdinand Mannlicher - hence why the gun is often referred to as the 'Mannlicher-Carcano.'

A well trained crew can fire between 8 to 10 rounds per minute making it capable for incredible suppressive fire."
  ITA_infantry_at2: "Fucile Anticarro S-2"
  ITA_infantry_at2_desc: "A 7.9mm anti-tank rife; the Fucile Anticarro S-2 is a Mauser-style bolt action rifle fed from a 4 round magazine. The barrel has a muzzle break that reduces recoil. It can penetrate 15mm of armour at 300 metres distance and 33mm of armour at 100 metres."
  ITA_support_weapons: "Fiat-Revelli M14 & Stokes mortar"
  ITA_support_weapons_desc: " The standard machine guns of the Italian Army during the Weltkrieg, the Fiat-Revelli M14 features selective fire and a strip-fed magazine box of 50 or 100 bullets. Like the Stokes mortar; these Weltkrieg-era weapons have been repurposed for the ever growing threat of the continuation of the civil war."
  ITA_support_weapons2: "Breda M30 & Mortaio da 81 M35"
  ITA_support_weapons2_desc: "The Breda M30 is an unusual weapon. It is fed from a fixed magazine attached to its side and is loaded with steel 20 round stripper clips. The firing rate and low magazine capacity makes the weapon more ideal as a semi-automatic rifle instead of a light machine gun. The Mortaio 81 is a lightweight Brandt-style mortar that has seen great feedback in the testing ranges due to its range capacity and reliability. The mortar uses two shells; one heavy high-explosive shell and another lighter shell for long-distance fire."
  ITA_support_weapons3: "Breda M37 & Mortaio da 81 CEMSA L.P."
  ITA_support_weapons3_desc: "The Breda M37 is a medium machine gun produced by Breda. The gas-operated air cooled medium machine gun is fairly reliable in the field. Its slow rate of fire helps prevent overheating during prolonged fire and its powerful heavy bullet cartridge has excellent range and penetration."
  ITA_support_weapons4: "Breda Mod.5C & Mortaio da 81 CEMSA L.P"
  ITA_support_weapons4_desc: "The Breda Mod.5C is an Italian heavy machine gun. A reflection of Italian military doctrine, the Breda was intended for ambushes and attacks. While its rate of fire is slow (as with most Italian machine guns); the Breda 5C was still regarded as one of the deadliest weapons in the Italian arsenal given the Italian Army's lack of heavy machine guns and submachine guns."
  ITA_infantry_weapons2: "Beretta M1918/38"
  ITA_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Beretta M1918 is an Italian sub-machine gun used during the Weltkrieg. The gun was made from half of a Villar-Perosa aircraft submachine gun and features an incredible rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute. The 1938 variant features the same rate of fire as the iconic weapon but has been refined to reduce the weapon's recoil and increase its sturdiness."
  ITA_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Pavesi M40"
  ITA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The Pavesi M40 is an Italian semi-auto rifle chambered for the 8x59 Breda cartridge. It is a short recoil action with 4-lug rotating bolt and uses a Mannlicher bloc clip."
  ITA_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "TZ-44"
  ITA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "Designed by a colonel and gunsmith (Tonon and Zorzoli hence the name 'TZ'); the TZ-44 is an impressive sub-machine gun capable of firing 9x19mm Parabellum at 800 rounds per minute. The gun action is simple blowback but the return spring is assembled around a guide rod which is in two pieces and telescopes as the bolt returns. Like other Italian weapons, the gun features selective fire. It also features a noteworthy 'double safety' to ensure that accidental discharges would not happen."

Built to haul heavy trains on the mountainous lines of the Northern Appennine, while keeping a comparatively low axle load of 14 tons to run on older, less frequently mantained tracks, these engines excelled in their task, and were subsequently built in copious number before the Great War. Distributed across the Peninsula to relieve the older pre-nationalisation engines, a good number of those engines ended up hauling heavy military trains (tradotte) during the War, and subsequently remained in our hands."
  ITA_train_equipment_2: "FS Gruppo 480"
  ITA_train_equipment_2_short: "FS Gr. 480"
  ITA_train_equipment_2_desc: "An evolution of the Austrian design for the pre-war Südbahn 580 Class, the 480 Group is a series of 'Decapod' class locomotives designed with heavy service on the Brenner Line towards Central Europe in mind. Though their higher axle load compared to their predecessors makes them harder to operate on older lines, various improvements such as the Caprotti valve gear make them both more powerful and cheaper to operate."
