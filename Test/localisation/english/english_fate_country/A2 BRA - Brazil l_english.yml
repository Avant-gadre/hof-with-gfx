##Equip-land
 BRA_infantry_equipment_0: "Espingarda Mauser Modelo 1908"
 BRA_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Espingarda Mauser M08"
 BRA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1908 is an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically."
 BRA_infantry_equipment_1: "Fusil Mauser modelo 1935"
 BRA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Fusil m35"
 BRA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilises a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the German model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers quickly became a priority for the government."
 BRA_infantry_equipment_2: "Bergmann Submetralhadora Modelo 1938"
 BRA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Bergmann M38"
 BRA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 BRA_infantry_equipment_3: "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 BRA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Rossi M44"
 BRA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest German semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Brazilian army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear.."
 BRA_support_weapons: "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 BRA_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome MG. Model 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance and found newfound efficiency. Many such older pieces of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 BRA_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 BRA_support_weapons2_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 BRA_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 BRA_support_weapons3_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 39 (MG39) was an improvement over the MG34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstacles and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 BRA_support_weapons4: "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 BRA_support_weapons4_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."
 BRA_infantry_at: "Metralhadora Anti-Tanque Imbel .50"
 BRA_infantry_at_desc: "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."
 BRA_infantry_at2: "Lança Rojão M44"
 BRA_infantry_at2_desc: "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."

 BRA_artillery_equipment_1: "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 BRA_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 BRA_artillery_equipment_2: "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 BRA_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 BRA_artillery_equipment_3: "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 BRA_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Bahian army until the 1960s."
 BRA_artillery_equipment_1_short: "Ob. Rm. de 10,5 cm"
 BRA_artillery_equipment_2_short: "Ob. M41 de 11,5cm"
 BRA_artillery_equipment_3_short: "Ob. M43 de 17cm"
 BRA_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "CAA M2 de 2cm"
 BRA_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "CAA M5 de 3,7cm"
 BRA_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "CAA M7 de 8,8cm"
 BRA_anti_air_equipment_1: "Canhão Antiaéreo M2 de 2cm"
 BRA_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 BRA_anti_air_equipment_2: "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 BRA_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 BRA_anti_air_equipment_3: "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 BRA_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "CAT Alemão de 3,7 cm"
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "CAT de 7,5 cm"
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "CAT M6 de 12,8 cm"
 BRA_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 32cm"
 BRA_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Following the specifications of the original models, rockets of 32cm were used in these weapons, and a lack of said rockets is exactly why they were seldom used."
 BRA_rocket_artillery_equipment_2: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 21cm"
 BRA_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Changes to the size of the rockets required for usage made later models more common, but still far from standard issue and few pieces of the LF de 21cm were used in the field when compared to even the M43."
