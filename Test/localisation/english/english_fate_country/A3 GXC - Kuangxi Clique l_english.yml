 GXC_infantry_equipment_0: "Guangdong Type 88"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Guangdong Type 88"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Originally a product of late Guangxu era 'Self Strengthening' efforts, the Type 88 was designed as a close copy of the German Gewehr 88 with export modifications. While collectively inferior to newer rifles despite improvements, and often poorly maintained, the weapon is known to be rugged and reliable if unwieldy.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Guangdong Arsenal, though equipment shortages and personal preference often see it used alongside non-standard weapons such as the Dadao."
 GXC_infantry_equipment_1: "Guangdong Type 27"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Guangdong Type 27"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Originally called the 'Xuantong Type 27', this rifle was put into Qing service in 1935 through German assistance after the Restoration. The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nFirst produced at the Hanyang arsenal with German tools, manufacturing methods have already spread to Guangdong, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."
 GXC_infantry_equipment_2: "Tsingtao MP18"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Tsingtao MP18"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Thanks to the flood of Weltkrieg surplus into the world market in the early 1920s, the MP18 saw action in China some time before a modified version began production in Tsingtao.\n\nWith changes to the magazine and stock, this particular product of Sino-German cooperation has been copied and sold throughout Northern and Southern China, though primarily to the Qing Government."
 GXC_infantry_equipment_3: "Guangdong Xinhai Type 33"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Guangdong Type 33"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Type 33 is a semi-automatic rifle based on the General Liu rifle from 1914. While appearing similar, the Type 33 is shorter, has the rear of the receiver covered, and the gas-trap system replaced by a simple gas port. The new rifle is also no longer able to switch to manual action and uses magazines from the Bohemian ZH-29 rifle and ZB-26 light machine gun."

 GXC_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "37mm Hanyang Type 18"
 GXC_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Although this is actually the '37mm Hanyang Type 21' commonly equipped by the Qing army, some ardent republicans instead call it the Xinhai Type 18 according to the Republic of China's Xinhai calendar."

 GXC_gw_armored_car_equipment_desc: "Since the early 1930s, the Liangguang Clique imported a large number of American GMC 3/4-ton trucks, and used their chassis to mass-produce a batch of armoured vehicles equipped with three 7.62mm light machine guns. Although the armoured vehicle's manoeuvrability is low due to the large amount of armour added, it is almost invincible in the face of bandits in Guangdong and Guangxi."
 GXC_armored_car_equipment_1: "Guangzhou 6-wheel Combat Vehicle"
 GXC_armored_car_equipment_1_short: "6-lun Zhanche"
 GXC_armored_car_equipment_1_desc: "After the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, many American military GMC Six-wheel drive trucks entered the international arms market. Liangguang quickly sensed the opportunity and purchased a small number of these trucks and rebuilt them into armoured vehicles.\n\nThis armoured vehicle is equipped with a rotatable heavy machine gun turret, below which is a 37mm infantry support gun facing the front, alongside two sponson-mounted machine guns at either side of the car body. The relative size and power of this vehicle on the Chinese battlefield makes it nothing less than a 'monster' in the eyes of most other warlords."
