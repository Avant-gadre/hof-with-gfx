 BEL_Direction_of_the_Industry: "Direction of the Industry"
 BEL_Direction_of_the_Industry_desc: "Wallonia was the beating heart of Belgian industry. It cannot be denied that the fate of the forges and factories are intimately linked with that of the entire nation.

 BEL_Create_The_Industrial_Committee_desc: "The nation's many great industrial companies compete vigorously for the slightest economic advantage.

 BEL_Exploitation_of_Charleroi_Glass_Industry_desc: "Charleroi is one of the foremost producers of glass in the world.

 BEL_Rally_Behind_the_Lion_desc: "Our best way of Flemish support is to ensure that their hatred for the French is greater than their hatred for us.

 BEL_Stop_the_Flamenpolitik: "Stop the Flamenpolitik"
 BEL_Stop_the_Flamenpolitik_desc: "The Flamenpolitik was originally founded by the German occupants during the Weltkrieg and dictated a policy of causing internal divide by favouring Flemish over Walloons.

 BEL_Combat_German_Favoritism: "Combat German Favouritism"
 BEL_Combat_German_Favoritism_desc: "A large problem in our nation is that German citizens are favoured by the Government and many high-ranking positions are solely reserved for citizens with the German nationality.

 BEL_Reform_The_Provincial_System: "Reform the Provincial System"
 BEL_Reform_The_Provincial_System_desc: "To better understand the needs of the people, the Government has decided to reform the provincial system.

 BEL_Diamant: "Monopolise the Diamond Industry"
 BEL_Diamant_desc: "When you say diamond, you say Antwerp. As the world's biggest centre of the diamond trade, with 80% of all diamonds ending up in our city and bolstered by the support of the mostly Jewish population, we have almost a complete monopoly on the diamond trade in Mitteleuropa."
 BEL_Zeebrugge: "Found the Zeebrugge Dockyards"

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."
