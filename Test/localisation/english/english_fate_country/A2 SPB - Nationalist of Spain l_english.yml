 SPB_strengthen_the_country_desc: "Our country are in threat of a civil war,we need to take action now!"
 SPB_focus_economy: "Focus on the Economy"
 SPB_focus_economy_desc: "Spain faces massive unemployment and economic hardship. Until we address these issues, the people will continue to be restless and receptive to revolutionary ideas. To prevent civil war, we should implement comprehensive economic reform."
 SPB_cig: "Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra"
 SPB_cig_desc: "Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra, the War Industries Commission, has been established in Catalonia with the stated purpose of ensuring the country is ready for war."
 SPB_northern_industry: "Industrial Expansions in Northern Spain"
 SPB_northern_industry_desc: "For centuries the stronghold of the Carlist movement has been in the north of Spain. In the event of a civil war, there is no doubt that these territories will remain loyal to the Carlist cause, and any industrial investments in these regions are bound to end up in the hands of their troops."
 SPB_galician_tungsten: "Invest in Galicia"
 SPB_galician_tungsten_desc: "With the situation turning dire, it seems time to already prepare for the inevitable. Galicia's untapped tungsten reserves are plentiful, and is likely to be isolated from any potential conflict within the nation. By focusing on establishing mines to extract this tungsten, vital northern munition factories will be much less restricted by resource constraints."
 SPB_construction_focus: "New Construction"
 SPB_construction_focus_desc: "Economic revitalisation necessitates the construction of new infrastructure and industry alike. By providing jobs to the jobless, perhaps we can distract their political frustrations."
 SPB_zaragozan_steelworks: "Expand Zaragozan Steelworks"
 SPB_zaragozan_steelworks_desc: "Zaragoza is home to some of the largest steelworks in the entire nation, and as a result it is also home to some of the strongest unions in all of Spain. As the city will certainly fall under the control of Syndicalist rebels, investing in an expansion of the steelworks there will greatly aid their potential industrial capacity."
 SPB_civ_production: "New Factories"
 SPB_civ_production_desc: "While state-sponsored factories are never the most efficient, this will be a way for us to get the people working... and for more trade to flow into Spain. Everyone will benefit!"
 SPB_new_jobs: "Jobs for the People"
 SPB_new_jobs_desc: "There is so much to be done, but already we have put a great portion of the unemployed back to work. We need to spread the word to the people and reassure them that things are not as dire as they seem. If they only give the kingdom a chance, and time to rebuild, we will prove to them they have made the right choice."
 SPB_repurpose_steel_mills: "Repurpose Steel Mills"
 SPB_repurpose_steel_mills_desc: "Steel mills employ many in our nation and make up a vital part of our economy, however desperate times such as these call for desperate measures. Restructuring a few of the steel mills in southern Spain into more generalised factories may be enough to give us the edge if the ongoing tensions bubble over into full blown conflict, even if it may permanently harm the region's steel industry."
 SPB_relocate_factories_seville: "Relocate Industry to the South"
 SPB_relocate_factories_seville_desc: "If things in Spain do truly escalate into civil war, our government stands little chance of holding much north or east of Madrid. It has therefore been proposed that we preemptively move as much industry as we can to Seville, due to it being one of the largest urban areas in the nation and an area that will hopefully be far from the frontlines."
 SPB_focus_military: "Focus on the Military"
 SPB_focus_military_desc: "The civil war is likely to come, no matter what we do. While it would still be best if we found another way, we must also prepare for the worst - and that means bolstering our military for the coming battles."
 SPB_roads_of_war: "The Roads of War"
 SPB_roads_of_war_desc: "Even during the times of Roman Hispania roads were vital not only to daily life but also to warfare. Without a proper network of roads, and in the modern age railways, supplying and repositioning troops is near impossible. By improving the roads of eastern Spain, we can ensure that any uprising can quickly organise itself into a proper frontline."
 SPB_mil_production: "Increase Arms Production"
 SPB_mil_production_desc: "The economy will need to take a back seat to new factories which can produce bombs and guns. These we will need first - the rest can come later."
 SPB_mil_planning: "Review Our Leadership"
 SPB_mil_planning_desc: "Some might call it a 'purge', but it's very simple - we need to look to the officers who lead our forces, and ensure that those who remain in the higher positions are not secretly loyal to the Carlists or the anarcho-syndicalists. Those who remain must come together and talk of military planning. Let us ensure we have every scenario accounted for before the firing begins."
 SPB_fortify_madrid: "Fortify Madrid"
 SPB_fortify_madrid_desc: "Our capital, here in the heart of Spain, is also our weakest link. It can easily be surrounded, and our enemies know that capturing the Royal Family would ensure we instantly lay down our arms. We cannot allow this to happen, even if it means turning beautiful Madrid into a veritable fortress."
 SPB_defend_burgos: "The Stronghold of Burgos"
 SPB_defend_burgos_desc: "Burgos has been firmly established as the metaphorical stronghold of the Carlist movement, with the government having already lost de facto control of the city. If the Carlist movement is to succeed, Burgos must be transformed into a much less metaphorical stronghold. Defensive positions should be established throughout the city, and even the old castle can be home to anti-air batteries to ensure Javier's ultimate triumph."
 SPB_army_of_africa: "Recall the Ejército de África"
 SPB_army_of_africa_desc: "The Ejército de África, the Army of Africa, were fundamental to our success in crushing the native rebellion that rose up in the Rif. It seems unlikely that we will face further rebellion in the region in the short term, and so we are presented with the opportunity to recall General Franco's troops back to Cádiz to prepare for any insurrection on the mainland instead."
 SPB_kings_proclamation: "The Proclamation of the True King"
 SPB_kings_proclamation_desc: "No matter who or what they support, it is always painful for the blood of Spaniards to be spilled. While it seems unlikely at this stage that Javier can be peacefully restored to the throne, a proclamation from the true king declaring the end of Alfonso's reign and urging a peaceful transfer of power may convince some Alfonsists to lay down their arms and help save some Spanish lives from being needlessly lost."
 SPB_autarky: "Autarky"
 SPB_autarky_desc: "For our position to not be threatened by others we must ensure our economy is entirely self-sufficient."

 SPB_relocate_the_gold_reserves: "Relocate the Gold Reserves"
 SPB_relocate_the_gold_reserves_desc: "Our gold reserves are key in the purchase of war materials from abroad. We must ensure it is stored in a safe location, which unfortunately necessitates moving it abroad."

 SPB_call_for_unity_desc: "Throughout this period of healing and reconcillation our nation has had to go through, our King has acted as a uniting beacon of stability. No matter the political changes or disagreements we experience, [SPA.getleader] and his successors will always be with us to guide our nation forward."
 SPB_rights_spanish: "Restore the Rights of the Spanish"
 SPB_rights_spanish_desc: "Since Primo de Rivera's coup in 1923, the Spanish Constitution has remained suspended, which evidently has not mended the rifts in Spanish society as shown by the outbreak of civil war. Therefore the Spanish Constitution will be restored and the fundamental rights of the Spanish will be recognised, so long as the exercise of these rights does not go against the spiritual, national and social unity of Spain."
 SPB_adopt_the_26_points: "Adopt the 26 Points"
 SPB_adopt_the_26_points_desc: "Having conveniently removed the stipulation against the merger of political parties from the Falange's \"27 Points\", the resulting \"26 Points\" makes for a good party manifesto that we can borrow from for inspiration on government policies."
 SPB_dictator_for_life: "Dictator for Life"
 SPB_dictator_for_life_desc: "Franco has served his nation well. We see no need to change this state of affairs, and certainly not to return to the weak monarchy of old."
 SPB_arrest_leaders: "Arrest the Malcontents"
 SPB_arrest_leaders_desc: "We will never have true peace while radicals are free to foment discord. While they will certainly do their best to rise up, their time is done and they know it. We must capture the worst of the leaders and put them away - this is the path to lasting unity for Spain."
 SPB_jan: "Rally the JAN"
 SPB_jan_desc: "The Juventudes de Acción Nacional are the youth wing of our party and have captured the boundless energy hidden within the Spanish youth, which is far different to the desolate and enervating scepticism of our defeatists and intellectuals. The JAN faithfully came to the aid of Spain during the civil war by recruiting many volunteers for our holy cause. Now that the war is over, the JAN should be expanded and provide a home for all of our society's young."
 SPB_spanish_man: "The New Spanish Man"
 SPB_spanish_man_desc: "The anarchic generation of 98 and their ideas have created a sad, harsh and vinegary Spanish youth. We shall forge new men: an authentic, happy, optimistic, Spanish youth unlike the current that is riddled with defeatism and lacking in vision."
 SPB_organic_democracy: "Organic Democracy"
 SPB_organic_democracy_desc: "Instead of petty things like liberal principles, parliamentarism, political parties, and universal suffrage, Spanish Democracy will be based on natural social institutions such as the Family or Municipality, ensuring that Party Politics will cease to corrupt the Spanish people. A bicameral system will be created: Legislative power will be exercised by a Congress elected by universal suffrage  and by a Senate representing organised social interests."
 SPB_new_constitution: "Absorb the Carlists"
 SPB_new_constitution_desc: "Though misguided in their struggle against us, the Carlists have far more in common with us than the anarchists. With our shared beliefs in God, Family and Country, it will not be difficult to ally them and bring peace to this troubled land."
 SPB_fortify_the_central_government: "Fortify the Central Government"
 SPB_fortify_the_central_government_desc: "We must fortify the government against communist influence, lest they surreptitiously manage to take take control of the Republic from within."
 SPB_secure_democratic_principles: "Secure Democratic Principles"
 SPB_secure_democratic_principles_desc: "We cannot let communist influence alter or even destroy the principles upon which the Second Republic was founded - no matter our relationship to the communists or [SOV.GetNameDef], these principles must be carried in our hearts, if not openly."
 SPB_strengthen_the_anti_fascist_coalition: "Strengthen the Anti-Fascist Coalition"
 SPB_strengthen_the_anti_fascist_coalition_desc: "We have eliminated the dissenting parts of our coalition - hopefully this means we now may finally focus on strengthening our united resolve in rooting out fascism."
 SPB_national_catholicism: "National Catholicism"
 SPB_national_catholicism_desc: "The rules and teachings of the Catholic church will be an integral part of Spanish Law. The church will have pride of place in making the laws while [SPA.getleader] will make sure that the church is protected."
 SPB_unity_at_last: "A National Movement"
 SPB_unity_at_last_desc: "We must aim to be a movement above petty party politics that any true Spaniard can rally behind. The Liberals, Marxists and Freemasons dare to threaten our great nation but they shall never succeed, for we have our Catholic faith beside us and once Spain has been united, the world will know that we are whole and not to be trifled with."
 SPB_corporate_state: "A Corporate State"
 SPB_corporate_state_desc: "Society will be centred around the natural bodies of association: the family, where one is born; the municipality, where one lives; the union, where one works. The exercise of any individual right is conditioned to the decisions made by these traditional social corporations while issues relating to religion will be handled by ecclesiastical organisations."
 SPB_charter_of_labour: "Fuero del Trabajo"
 SPB_charter_of_labour_desc: "A Charter of Labour will be drafted to resolve the issues caused by labour disputes and revolutionary unions. It's provisions will include the prohibition of strikes, the regulation of working hours and of rest, the creation of the Magistracy of Labour and the creation of the Spanish Trade Union Organisation as a sole trade union, which will group employers and workers equally, both subordinated to the decisions of the State."
 SPB_municipal_reorg: "Municipal Reorganisation"
 SPB_municipal_reorg_desc: "Carrying on from the Municipal Statute of 1924, José Calvo Sotelo has proposed further reorganisation of municipalities in order to finally regenerate municipal and political life and vanquish the plague of caciquismo. Provincial and local authorities will be replaced by trusted men to ensure that no forms of corruption will exist."
 SPB_safeguard_the_freedom_of_worship: "Safeguard The Freedom Of Worship"
 SPB_safeguard_the_freedom_of_worship_desc: "The Republicans threaten the faith in God itself, and we must make it clear to everyone that we are Christianity's last bastion. We will protect all Christians' right and freedom of worship, and all who wish may join our fight in their defense."
 SPB_reconcilliation: "Integrate Alfonsist Remnants"
 SPB_reconcilliation_desc: "Though misguided in their struggle against us, the Alfonsists have far more in common with us than the anarchists. With our shared beliefs in God, King and Country, it will not be difficult to ally them and bring peace to this troubled land."
 SPB_the_stabilization_plan: "The Stabilization Plan"
 SPB_the_stabilization_plan_desc: "We must steer away from the unreasonable Falangist dream of autarky and the untenable economic policies implemented in its pursuit. To achieve economic parity with the rest of the world we must look at economic liberalization instead, hopefully triggering an economic boom that will benefit all Spaniards."
 SPB_the_popular_front: "The Popular Front"
 SPB_the_popular_front_desc: "The danger posed by Fascism and religious superstitions to our personal liberties is paramount, and we must establish a broad front of political parties that are united in their opposition to the Right. Only if we band together will we be able to halt their advance and save our republic."
 SPB_the_popular_army: "The Popular Army"
 SPB_the_popular_army_desc: "Our new army will be made up of those untainted by the treachery of the military; those among the population who are zealous in their defense of the principles upon which the Republic is built, but who perhaps did not serve previously. Coupled with this reorganization we will also develop new arms and doctrines to aid this new army in their fight."
 SPB_distribute_arms_to_the_people: "Distribute Arms to the People"
 SPB_distribute_arms_to_the_people_desc: "Disloyalty in the military is now all but certain, and it is clear we cannot rely on them to defend the values of the Republic.

 SPB_no_pasaran: "¡No Pasarán!"

 SPB_anti_fascist_unity_desc: "Disagreements between our anarchist and anti-Stalinist allies and ourselves are growing worse. We cannot afford this escalating out of control.

 SPB_reaffirm_the_popular_front_strategy_desc: "It is imperative that the differences between us and our allies are, for the moment, forgotten, so that we may all focus on the more important fight: against the fascists."
 SPB_crush_the_revolution: "Crush the Revolution"
 SPB_crush_the_revolution_desc: "The independent manner in which the anarchist communes have conducted themselves has been a thorn in our side, and, quite frankly, their feeble defenses constitute a critical weakness in our frontlines.

 SPB_enlist_the_carabineros: "Enlist the Carabineros"
 SPB_enlist_the_carabineros_desc: "As a stop-gap measure to man the frontlines we must turn to unorthodox solutions. Without a military, the Carabineros, a paramilitary frontier guard and customs force, will serve as as good a force as any to man the trenches."
 SPB_enlarge_the_weapon_caches: "Enlarge the Weapon Caches"
 SPB_enlarge_the_weapon_caches_desc: "Ever since even before the 1934 Asturias Miners' Strike, weapon caches have been covertly established throughout the country, in preparation for the inevitable need to defend our liberties with military arms.

 SPB_suspend_the_constitution_desc: "We will make no progress as long as we adhere to a constitution that has repeatedly proven its fallibility and weakness. We will suspend it, paving the way for a military transitional government that may guide us through this necessary fratricide, which in turn will eventually make way for a new, strong, authoritarian government."
 SPB_abolish_parties: "Corporatise the Cortes"
 SPB_abolish_parties_desc: "Following a corporate model, the Cortes will be closed, with the National Consultative Assembly standing in their place. A fruitful evolutionary process will begin that will allow the transformation of national public life, creating a corporate and authoritarian State. The parliamentary system in its current form is a failure, and so a Supreme National Assembly is required to build a New Spain."
 SPB_national_revolution: "National Revolution"
 SPB_national_revolution_desc: "The Patriotic Union will bring forth a new order, sweeping away any vestiges of previous failed regimes.

 SPB_a_one_party_state_desc: "Democracy, rather than an end unto itself, as the Republicans would have us believe, is in fact naught but a means to wrest full control of the state from the weak and unworthy. We will do away with all other political parties, so that those with a strong vision will not be hindered in their pursuit for a Great Spain."

We will begin by establishing one in Aragon."
 SPB_arm_the_people: "Arm the People"
 SPB_arm_the_people_desc: "A national army can easily be used as a way for the government to maintain control over its populace, and so is no recourse for communal defense. It is the people themselves who must be given the arms with which to defend their communities."
 SPB_international_brigades: "International Brigades"
 SPB_international_brigades_desc: "Our cause has attracted much international attention, and people have come from all over the world to fight the fascist threat with us.

 SPB_masters_of_our_own_fate_desc: "The Stalinists and their Republican puppets increasingly infringe upon our freedoms, systematically undermining our efforts and eliminating prominent supporters of our cause.

 SPB_appropriate_the_means_of_production_desc: "Gone are the days when we worked for the wealthy. Gone are the days when our labor went unrewarded. We shall seize the factories and the workshops, the farms and the stores, eliminating class and putting the worker in charge of their own destiny."
 SPB_the_maximum_concession: "The Maximum Concession"
 SPB_the_maximum_concession_desc: "In the spirit of fighting fascism we have made the greatest concession possible: cooperation with the capitalists and authoritarian communists.

 SPB_autogestion: "Autogestión"

 SPB_collectivization_and_workers_control_desc: "For the necessary aspects of local government we will turn to workers' councils, giving every worker a say while also enabling larger-scale cooperation."
 SPB_class_war: "Class War"
 SPB_class_war_desc: "The concept of the Popular Front is flawed; the worker can never truly be free as long as they are forced to work together with the bourgeoisie. Only all-out uncompromising class war can bring us the freedom we desire, even if this means fighting the capitalists and the fascists at the same time."
 SPB_seize_the_gold_reserves: "Seize the Gold Reserves"
 SPB_seize_the_gold_reserves_desc: "The Republic's gold reserves are at risk of falling into Fascist, or possibly even worse, Stalinist hands.

 SPB_foreign_arms_purchases: "Foreign Arms Purchases"
 SPB_foreign_arms_purchases_desc: "The gold reserves we 'liberated' could be used to obtain foreign arms, which we are in desperate need of. International opinion is not necessarily supportive of us, so we will likely have to go through unorthodox channels to receive these, however..."

 SPB_all_must_bear_the_torch_desc: "Every person is a revolution unto itself; if not for the bravery and ferocity of the individual the collective would fall in the face of its enemies.

 SPB_anticlerical_desc: "The Catholic Church is a corrupt decadent institution that has routinely oppressed the peoples of Spain, and missed no opportunity to side with our enemies.

 SPB_popular_front: "Unifying the Popular Front"
 SPB_popular_front_desc: "We would have not succeeded in our revolution if it was not for our many socialist comrades who have united with us in one shared goal, despite differing views on socialist theory. It is imperative that we ensure continued unity within our coalition, for we do not wish to be destroyed by infighting like many prior failed socialist movements."
 SPB_beacon_socialism: "The Shining Beacon of Spanish Socialism"
 SPB_beacon_socialism_desc: "Our efforts over the past few months have come to fruition and the wave of socialism that has swept over the nation has firmly entrenched itself.

 SPB_reconcile_opposition: "Rehabilitate the Old Republicans"
 SPB_reconcile_opposition_desc: "When the old Republic fell many of its leftist members were further radicalised to supporting our cause, but many still stuck to their moderate misguided beliefs. Now that we have established a new republic once again, we should help guide these moderates towards socialism rather than outright reject them as reactionaries."
 SPB_red_nation_state: "The Red Nation State"

 SPB_reeducate_the_bourgeoisie_desc: "The Popular Front has run its course, and the time has come for the bourgeoisie to be re-educated and liberated from their economic and societal misconceptions. We will yet turn them into proper citizens of the state."
 SPB_national_union: "National Union"
 SPB_national_union_desc: "Under socialism there are Spaniards, there are no Galicians, there are no Catalans either. The only factor that truly divides us is class, and the proletariat of Iberia must be united under one nation if we are to defeat the bourgeois reactionaries."
 SPB_planned_economy: "Planned Economy"
 SPB_planned_economy_desc: "Allowing the free market to fester in Spain and destroy its economy was the downfall of the old regime. By instead introducing central economic planning we can ensure that the failures that led to our suffering during Black Monday will never again occur."

 SPB_a_great_spain_desc: "The fledgling Second Republic has failed in its duties to protect religion, family, and property. As the Left beleaguers our Christian civilization, the Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas will stand in its defense and give Spain true unity and a new spirit. Parliament will submit to the will of the people, or we will eliminate it."
 SPB_negotiate_carlist_support: "Negotiate Carlist Support"
 SPB_negotiate_carlist_support_desc: "Our cause has allies we but need to reach out to. Anti-clerical sentiment from the Left has antagonized the Carlists, who have long been preparing for a confrontation with the Republic. Should we gain their support, our uprising will be much strengthened."
 SPB_the_army_of_africa: "The Army of Africa"
 SPB_the_army_of_africa_desc: "The key to victory in the upcoming struggle is the seasoned Army of Africa.

 SPB_secure_the_northern_garrisons: "Secure the Northern Garrisons"
 SPB_secure_the_northern_garrisons_desc: "Using the proper 'encouragement' we will obtain the support of the garrison commanders in the North.

 SPB_con_paquito: "Con Paquito"
 SPB_con_paquito_desc: "Our cause needs strong leaders, and Francisco Franco commands the loyalty of the vaunted Army of Africa. For our uprising to succeed, and despite his dallying in making a decision, we must enlist his support, though this will likely come at a price..."
 SPB_sin_paquito: "Sin Paquito"
 SPB_sin_paquito_desc: "The government, fearing his potential disloyalty, has sent Francisco Franco to command the forces in the Canarias. However, despite our invitations, he has not promised us his support either, and merely delays us with his indecisiveness. If \"Miss Canary Islands 1936\" will not decide to join us, then we will simply proceed without him."
 SPB_legion_espanola: "Legión Española"
 SPB_legion_espanola_desc: "The army of Spain was one of the greatest armies in the world. With the outbreak of civil war in our nation and the splintering of the remaining army we should use this as an opportunity to reform the soldiers loyal to us into a new army, the Legión Española."

 SPB_requetes_desc: "The Requetés have long been part of the Carlist army since the first Carlist War.

 SPB_word_of_god: "Word of God"
 SPB_word_of_god_desc: "The radio has been a useful tool saving many a soldier's life during the civil war, leading to their nickname of the \"Word of God\". With how useful these radios have been, we should invest in further radio technology to help ensure more of our troops survive."

 SPB_revolutionary_officers: "Escuelas Populares de Guerra"
 SPB_revolutionary_officers_desc: "Our officer training started as a makeshift endeavour where defectors from the Kingdom´s military and law enforcement taught our new aspiring officers however best they could. We need to standardise the curriculum, ensure proper testing and grant access to any competent candidate. Unlike the reactionaries, we value capacity over connections, family or wealth, and that reliance on talent will pay by itself very soon."

 SPB_unbreakable_spirit_desc: "With the revolution in our hearts we will not surrender after a few simple battles. We will fight battle after battle until we have emerged victorious."
 SPB_militia_focus: "Soldiers of the Revolution"
 SPB_militia_focus_desc: "Our first order of business is to look to our army - to ensure that it consists of hard workers, those devoted to the new socialist order. Anyone who still holds to the old ways, or who clings too much to faith as more important than their ideology, must be summarily purged from the ranks and replaced with true members of the working class."
 SPB_a_revolutionary_army: "A Revolutionary Army"
 SPB_a_revolutionary_army_desc: "It was not long ago that our army was hopelessly outdated, barely advancing since the Napoleonic Wars.

 SPB_guardia_civil: "Guardia Civil"

 SPB_tank_shipments_desc: "If we are to win this ongoing war, we will need as many tanks as possible deployed to the battlefield.

Our marines shall be once again restored to a status truly befitting their legacy."

 SPB_battle_cruisers_support_desc: "While dreadnoughts are the pride of the Spanish Navy, armoured cruisers will also serve a vital role as escorts for our navy."
 SPB_defend_the_coast: "Guardians of the Spanish Coast"
 SPB_defend_the_coast_desc: "The Spanish Navy shall focus on defending Spain itself. While it shall not be as large as some want, it will be respected and it shall defend Spain from all enemies."
 SPB_coast_guard: "Establish a Dedicated Coast Guard"
 SPB_coast_guard_desc: "Currently Spain lacks any form of dedicated coast guard force, with most of the duties being handled by the Guardia Civil until recently.

 SPB_protect_our_colonies: "Protect Our Colonies"
 SPB_protect_our_colonies_desc: "The overseas colonies that we still hold are of vital interest to Spain and we should use our navy to protect the coast of our colonies from all attackers. However in case that is not viable, several well placed coastal forts and batteries shall do the job."

 SPB_academia_basica_del_aire_desc: "Modern wars are fought not only on the land and across the seas, but also in the skies. Modern air doctrines must be instilled into our pilots, and state of the art planes must be built if we expect to be victorious in our battles."
 SPB_new_pilots: "Training New Pilots"
 SPB_new_pilots_desc: "Most of our current air force is made up of eager volunteers and former pilots of civilian aircraft, with little to no knowledge of military aviation. It is therefore imperative that these recruits receive proper training before they are deployed in the skies, as their experience will hopefully give us the edge we need over our rivals."
 SPB_paratrooper_focus: "Desperta Ferro!"
 SPB_paratrooper_focus_desc: "By the end of the Middle Ages, a famous company of Aragonese mercenaries, the Almogávares, made their war cry “Awake the Iron” famous across the Mediterranean.

 SPB_upgrade_air_ports: "Nationalise Civilian Aerodromes"
 SPB_upgrade_air_ports_desc: "The infrastructure needed to support a large air force does not need to be built completely from the ground up. Across the country there are many civilian aerodromes which we would be able to nationalise and expand into proper military airports, saving us significant time in establishing new airfields for our pilots to use."
 SPB_army_air_support: "Army Air Support"
 SPB_army_air_support_desc: "The easiest enemy to fight is one who has already been killed by a bombing run before the battle begins, and so our air force should be focused on producing planes focused on battlefield support missions and bombing efforts to support our troops in their endeavours."
 SPB_bombers: "Bomber Effort"
 SPB_bombers_desc: "To truly assist the army, our air force must be capable of destroying fortified positions and disrupting enemy infrastructure. To accomplish this, we should focus on the development of new tactical and strategic bombers."
 SPB_foreign_airplanes: "Purchase Foreign Planes"
 SPB_foreign_airplanes_desc: "Our country is not really in the position to manufacture an air force. For this reason, we must purchase old planes from abroad to help kickstart the Spanish Air Force. The air war is likely to become of greater importance as the Weltkrieg had suggested decades ago."
 SPB_voice_of_heaven: "Eyes of Heaven"
 SPB_voice_of_heaven_desc: "Radar is a promising new technology which, with further development could provide a wealth of information about enemy tactics and positions and reveal the course of enemy aircraft. Several pilots have begun calling radar the Eyes of Heaven for how much they are able to reveal and see."

 SPB_rule_the_skies_desc: "The air force is no longer a rag-tag collection of volunteers, but a fully functioning organ of our military. Let us rule the skies of Spain and beyond!"

 SPB_empower_the_unions_desc: "Unions are fundamental to Syndicalism and the liberation of the working class. For the Spanish economy to truly thrive we must greatly empower our country's unions, which will bring power back to the humble worker."
 SPB_true_socialist_education: "True Socialist Education"
 SPB_true_socialist_education_desc: "The state of education we have inherited from the reactionaries is a disgrace.

 SPB_expand_real_academia: "Bring Socialism to Real Academia"

 SPB_resource_extraction: "Extract Natural Resources"
 SPB_resource_extraction_desc: "Spain has an abundance of minerals that can be exploited. We should survey the land for new deposits and export these minerals abroad. Of particular interest is Galician tungsten. There is great potential to be found there."

 SPB_provincial_rebuilding_desc: "We should look at rebuilding the various provinces and let their economy improve and recover."
 SPB_military_investments: "Military Investments"

 SPB_comercial_investment: "Commercial Subsidies"
 SPB_comercial_investment_desc: "The many private companies that are at the heart of the Spanish economy have been torn apart and left in ruins following both Black Monday and the Civil War.

 SPB_expand_royal_academia: "Expand Royal Academia"
 SPB_expand_royal_academia_desc: "The Royal Academies are the highest education schools within Spain. Many often specialise in one particular field or connected fields, such as science, medicine, history, language and so on.

 SPB_industrial_nationalisation: "Industrial Nationalisation"
 SPB_industrial_nationalisation_desc: "While our government has often supported free market industrial endeavours, the nationalisation of key industry during this turbulent time of reconstruction may significantly aid the rebuilding process and should be considered. The question of if and how we should return the industry to the original owners after this period of nationalisation is simply one for a future time, preferably far enough that it no longer matters."
 SPB_military_factories: "Expand the Arms Industry"
 SPB_military_factories_desc: "War will likely come to Spain in the future. The godless Commune of France sits just across the Pyrenees after all. Thus in order to prepare for that future war, we should build new military factories."
 SPB_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
 SPB_modern_agriculture_desc: "The many small farm estates of the countryside have struggled during the recent troubles we have faced, as they have been unable to adopt new agricultural technologies and methods of cultivation.

 SPB_catholic_trade_unions: "Catholic Trade Unions"
 SPB_catholic_trade_unions_desc: "Trade unions are unfortunately rather important in the modern economy, and we cannot simply get rid of them completely. However instead of alienating them we should instead promote Catholic trade unions as an alternative. This will help give us greater control over the working classes as well as help deradicalise the unions that sided with the godless syndicalists."
 SPB_spanish_miracle: "Spanish Miracle"

 SPB_place_in_the_world_desc: "With all the troubles which have afflicted the kingdom, we have come to be treated as a second-class country within Europe - a nation to be ignored, or even one which might be seen as an easy target. Now that we have reasserted our position, it is time to restore our contact with the rest of the world, and to let them know our strength has returned."
 SPB_the_inevitable_counterblow: "The Inevitable Counterblow"

 SPB_global_defense_council: "Global Defense Council"
 SPB_global_defense_council_desc: "Our borders have expanded beyond the geography of the Iberian peninsula, and the title we have given to our temporary defense council is no longer representative for all who are a part of it.

 SPB_plant_the_seeds_of_revolution: "Plant the Seeds of Revolution"
 SPB_plant_the_seeds_of_revolution_desc: "Those with sentiments akin to ours have long been silenced by their oppressive governments. We will give these groupings the weapons they need, so they may topple their nations from within, and join our case when we rout our enemies and link up with them."

 SPB_bounties_of_neutrality: "The Bounties of Neutrality"
 SPB_bounties_of_neutrality_desc: "War is good for business, and even better when you're not involved in it. By sitting on the sidelines of any ongoing conflicts in the world, we are able to conduct trade regardless of allegiances and thus we stand to greatly profit from these conflicts."
 SPB_increased_volunteers: "Unofficial Intervention"
 SPB_increased_volunteers_desc: "Just because we are officially neutral, it does not mean that our private citizens must also be neutral. Many in our country still wish to fight in conflicts overseas, and it would be wrong to stop them from doing so.

 SPB_influx_of_refugees: "Influx of Refugees"
 SPB_influx_of_refugees_desc: "Being a neutral country in Europe during this great war has resulted in an influx of refugees fleeing their homes and arriving in Spain to be free of conflict.

 SPB_putting_refugees_to_work: "Putting the Refugees to Work"
 SPB_putting_refugees_to_work_desc: "The Spanish state is not a charity organisation, if the refugees we have received wish to stay they must make themselves useful.

 SPB_lease_gibraltar: "Lease Gibraltar"
 SPB_lease_gibraltar_desc: "While we may officially be neutral in the ongoing conflict between French and its Syndicalist rivals, it does not mean we do not wish for a French victory over the godless socialists.
