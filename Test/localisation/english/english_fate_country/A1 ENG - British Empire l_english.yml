 ENG_infantry_equipment_0_short: "No.1 Mk III"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mk III has served the Tommy since 1907, an iconic weapon of the Weltkrieg. The SMLE Mk III came with the 1907 Pattern bayonet and a simplified rear sight arrangement, and a fixed charger guide. During the Weltkrieg, demand outstripped supply and thus many copies of the Mk III comes with the deletion of the magazine cutoff."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle No.4 Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_short: "No.4 Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the threat of the great war it became apparent that the No.3 Enfield was not fit for urban combat.\" Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.In 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, and a simplified bolt system.\"The No.4 is the newest member in the family of Lee-Enfield rifles. While similar to its predecessors, the No.4 is stronger and easier to produce. A bit heavier due to its barrel; an interesting fact about the No.4 is that it comes with an aperture sight that is set at increments of 100 yds (91m); calibrated for 200-1,300 yards (183-1189 metres)."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2: "No.2 Machine-Carbine Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2_short: "No.2 MC Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the future of warfare gravitating towards hand-held automatic weapons and the clouds of war looming in Europe once more, the technicians at the RSAF and the men at Station IX have created a new submachine gun. Light and portable, the No.2 machine carbine is ideally suited for urban operations and medium to close-range combat."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3: "No.9 Machine-Rifle Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3_short: "No.9 MR Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "Experience fighting against German troops armed with the Maschinenkarabiner 44 and comparisons with French designs led Stefan Kennneth Janson at RSAF to create a new bullpup rifle. Capable of switching firing modes from semi-automatic to fully automatic; the No.9 rifle will provide the Tommy with extensive firepower."
 ENG_infantry_at: "Boys Anti-Tank Rifle"
 ENG_infantry_at_desc: "Often nicknamed the 'Elephant Gun' due to its size and large bore, the Boys Anti-Tank rifle can fire a 60g AP projectile at 747 m/s. However, despite the weapon's recoil slide and rubber cushioned buttpad, the recoil of the weapon was said to be painful, frequently causing neck strains and bruised shoulders."
 ENG_infantry_at2: "anti-armoured Device MK2"
 ENG_infantry_at2_desc: "The anti-armoured device MK2 is one of the newest tinkerments developed by the Station IX. With an effective firing range of 115 yard, the MK2 will be able to knock out and pierce the heaviest of the Kaiser's panzers."

 ENG_support_weapons_desc: "The Vickers MG and Stokes mortar were iconic weapons of the British Army during the Weltkrieg. Following the revolution and the civil war; large quantities of these weapons still exist in the arsenals of the RSAF. Though outclassed in this day and age; they can still be used effectively."
 ENG_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 ENG_support_weapons3: "Enfield-Automatic Mk IIIB & ML 3 inch mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons3_desc: "The Enfield-Automatic Mk IIIB is another creation of the RSAF. Seeking a replacement for the Vickers and Lewis; the Enfield-Automatic is magazine fed which reduces its rate of fire - however this prevents overheating. Much lighter than belt fed machine guns; the Enfield Automatic will serve the next generation of Tommies in the trenches. The ML 3inch mortar is able to provide effective close artillery support while being portable."
 ENG_support_weapons4: "Enfield-Automatic Mk V & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons4_desc: "As the war drags on; improvements to existing models are constantly being made. The Mk V variant of the Enfield-Automatic features a telescopic sight and an improved cooling system. The ML 4.2 inch mortar is a heavy mortar. Quite heavy but deadly, the mortar requires to be towed in order for it to be brought to the battlefield."
 ENG_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "No.1 MC Mk 1"
 ENG_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The latest development in British ingenuity, the Mark 1 Machine-Carbine is a fully automatic sub-machine gun. A successful and reliable design; the Mark 1 features a steady rate of fire and is quite light, weighing at about 6 pounds (2.7 kg), making it perfect for close-quarters combat."
 ENG_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "No.11 MR MK IV"
 ENG_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The MK IV variant of the MR Mk 1 \"MR4 for short\" represents the latest technological advancements in warfare.

 #Infantry Equip

 IMP_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Long, Ross Mk III"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Ross Mk III"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."
 IMP_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk V"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the loyal Dominions only had access to one arsenal capable of producing its service rifle. Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 IMP_infantry_equipment_2: "Carbine, Machine, Owen Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Gun"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 IMP_infantry_equipment_3: "Rifle, Self-Loading, Long Branch Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 IMP_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 IMP_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 IMP_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 IMP_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 IMP_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 IMP_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 IMP_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 IMP_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 IMP_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 IMP_night_vision: "Tabby Scope"
 IMP_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 IMP_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Machine, Thompson Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States."
 IMP_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Carbine, Machine, Lanchester Mk I"
 IMP_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 IMP_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Commando, De Lisle Mk I"
 IMP_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "What began as a private venture by engineer William Godfray de Lisle soon caught the attention of the RCMP's Special Branch looking to equip agents with improved weaponry. The De Lisle carbine is, essentially, a shortened SMLE converted to .45 ACP, a subsonic cartridge with an integrated suppressor. The suppressor and ammunition together produced as little as 85.5 decibels when firing, making it very suitable for commando operations."

##Naval Legacy
 RN.1.t: "The future of the Royal Navy"
 RN.1.d: "The second London Naval Treaty redefined the pattern of world naval power. In order to maintain the status of the world's first naval power, Britain stipulated the number and tonnage of capital ships in the negotiations. This treaty will become another great victory in the history of imperial diplomacy -- the situation should have developed in this direction. Japan's withdrawal made the treaty exist in name only. The intelligence obtained by MI6 shows that the situation is grim. Our biggest hypothetical enemies Germany and Japan are secretly and vigorously building new capital ships, and our control over the world's sea power becomes precarious. What's more unpleasant is that the lights in Brittany's military port do not go out day and night, which seems to show France's determination to compete for maritime hegemony. How can we lose to the French? Twenty years ago, the respected Lord John Fisher put forward a set of plans for the construction of the future Royal Navy, aiming to build a fast mobile fleet with high speed and heavy firepower to maximize the protection of the maritime interests of the Empire and its colonies. Unfortunately, his foresight could not be truly realized due to the technology at that time. Now, following his vision, the Admiralty sorted out a detailed naval construction plan, which was submitted to Parliament for discussion by the First Sea Lord and submitted to King Arthur for review. This key proposal determines the future of imperial sea power."
 RN.1.a: "The Royal Navy is the best of this world!"
 RN.1.b: "This is CHEATING! I do not need these ships."
 
 RN.2.t: "'Royal Navy development agreement 1937'"
 RN.2.d: "Lord Fisher believes that in order to take the initiative in the fleet decisive battle, speed is the most important. The fleet with speed advantage can freely choose the battle time and obtain the overwhelming advantage in strategy and tactics. The Battlecruiser is the product under the guidance of this thought, but this is only a transition. Advances in technology have made it possible for high-speed battleships to take into account firepower, armor and speed simultaneously. In order to gain an advantage over the German new battleships, the Navy initially set the main gun index at 406mm, but combined with the current severe economic situation of the Empire, we soon realized that it was impossible to complete a sufficient number of capital ships on time under this requirement, so we chose 356mm and 381mm main guns. On the other hand, facing the potential threat from the sky, the construction of naval aviation will become another important development direction of the Royal Navy. The final construction plan includes five 35000 ton high-speed battleships (King George V class) equipped with 356mm main guns, three 35000 ton high-speed battleships (Monarch class) equipped with 381mm main guns, four large fleet aircraft carriers (Illustrious class), 10 large light cruisers (Town class), and 40 fleet destroyers (24 J/K/N class and 16 Tribal class). The ships are expected to cost £ 150 million, and be completed in the next four years..."
 RN.2.a: "It is rare for parliament to pass a bill without any quarrel."
 RN.2.b: "King Arthur seems to have a different idea."
 
 RN.3.t: "the intervention from the King"
 RN.3.d: "Although the parliament unanimously agreed on the new ship construction plan, our king did not seem fully satisfied with its contents. In the subsequent cabinet meeting, she insisted that the design of 406mm main gun should not be abandoned, on the grounds that only 406mm main gun can gain an overwhelming advantage in the artillery battle with German new battleships, and if considering the competition with the French navy, we need more powerful capital ships, although this may lead to the lack of enough capital ships to protect all routes. Oh, Holy Jesus, she's even having a contest with the goddamn French. Many people are unconvinced, but who dares to question the great King Arthur? Soon, the new amendment was issued and passed. The new amendment abolished all battleships of 356mm and 381mm main gun, and replaced them with four 42000 ton high-speed battleships (lion class) equipped with 406mm main guns. Other construction plans remained unchanged. This makes the total investment of this plan reach 170 million pounds, and we have to wait longer to obtain new capital ships. God bless our king."
 RN.3.a: "Are we still a constitutional monarchy?"
