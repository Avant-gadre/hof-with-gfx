##Char Intro
 POLITICS_AGRAVAIN_DESC: "King Arthur's right arm, Agravain, is the key figure for the stable existence of the Knights of the Round Table. With the strategy and the iron fist to maintain the stability of the country's internal affairs and diplomacy, Agravain is the person who is willing to do dirty work. However, although he is full of suspicions about other Knights, his loyalty to King Arthur is undeniable."

 POLITICS_ARTURIA_PENDRAGON_DESC: "In Britain, which has a deep monarchy tradition, King Arthur's status in the country is unparalleled. Although the main ethnic group in Britain today is the Anglo-Saxon who King Arthur fought in the past, King Arthur will still guard her new people. For her, it is the responsibility of the monarch to guard the daily life of the British people compared to the artificially constructed concept of nationality and ethnicity. This Britain, of course, also includes the colonies of the British Empire in the world."
 
 POLITICS_ANIMUSPHERE_DESC: "The Animusphere family occupies one of the twelve monarchs of the Clock Tower, and Olga-Marie, who inherited the inheritance of the father, became one of the most influential politicians of the clock tower, and at the same time, the celestial body of Clock Tower, In fact, the plan for an artificial celestial body has been placed on her desk. The Animusphere family is known for its controlling energy industry, and there are rumors that its holding of so much energy is aimed at a large secret research project called "Chaldeas", Professor Lev, another member of Clock Tower, was also thought participating."

 POLITICS_GRAY_DESC: "$ENG_gray_yarg$ is a student of classroom El-Melloi, a member of the Clock Tower, but more importantly, she is a distant relative of King Arthur. In Camelot-London's dual system, Gray played an extremely important middleman role. As the representative of the king is in the clock tower, Gray can successfully coordinate the size conflict between Round Table and Clock Tower. At the same time, Gray is the organizer of a secret research project named “Rhongomyniad” and is directly responsible to King Arthur himself."

 #Infantry Equip

 ENG_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle No.1 Mk III"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_0_short: "No.1 Mk III"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mk III has served the Tommy since 1907, an iconic weapon of the Weltkrieg. The SMLE Mk III came with the 1907 Pattern bayonet and a simplified rear sight arrangement, and a fixed charger guide. During the Weltkrieg, demand outstripped supply and thus many copies of the Mk III comes with the deletion of the magazine cutoff."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle No.4 Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_short: "No.4 Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_desc: " After the threat of the great war it became apparent that the No.3 Enfield was not fit for urban combat.\" Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.In 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, and a simplified bolt system.\"The No.4 is the newest member in the family of Lee-Enfield rifles. While similar to its predecessors, the No.4 is stronger and easier to produce. A bit heavier due to its barrel; an interesting fact about the No.4 is that it comes with an aperture sight that is set at increments of 100 yds (91m); calibrated for 200-1,300 yards (183-1189 metres)."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2: "No.2 Machine-Carbine Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2_short: "No.2 MC Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2_desc: " With the future of warfare gravitating towards hand-held automatic weapons and the clouds of war looming in Europe once more, the technicians at the RSAF have created a new submachine gun. Light and portable, the No.2 machine carbine is ideally suited for urban operations and medium to close-range combat."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3: "No.9 Machine-Rifle Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3_short: "No.9 MR Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3_desc: " Experience fighting against German troops armed with the Maschinenkarabiner 44 and comparisons with French designs led Charles Babbage at RSAF to create a new bullpup rifle. Capable of switching firing modes from semi-automatic to fully automatic; the No.9 rifle will provide the Tommy with extensive firepower."
 ENG_infantry_at: "Boys Anti-Tank Rifle"
 ENG_infantry_at_desc: "Often nicknamed the 'Elephant Gun' due to its size and large bore, the Boys Anti-Tank rifle can fire a 60g AP projectile at 747 m/s. However, despite the weapon's recoil slide and rubber cushioned buttpad, the recoil of the weapon was said to be painful, frequently causing neck strains and bruised shoulders."
 ENG_infantry_at2: "Anti-armoured Device MK2"
 ENG_infantry_at2_desc: " The anti-armoured device MK2 is one of the newest tinkerments developed by the Imperial College of Engineering. With an effective firing range of 115 yard, the MK2 will be able to knock out and pierce the heaviest of the Siegfried's panzers."
 ENG_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons_desc: "The Vickers MG and Stokes mortar were iconic weapons of the British Army during the Weltkrieg. Following the revolution and the civil war; large quantities of these weapons still exist in the arsenals of the RSAF. Though outclassed in this day and age; they can still be used effectively."
 ENG_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 ENG_support_weapons3: "Enfield-Automatic Mk IIIB & ML 3 inch mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons3_desc: " The Enfield-Automatic Mk IIIB is another creation of the RSAF. Seeking a replacement for the Vickers and Lewis; the Enfield-Automatic is magazine fed which reduces its rate of fire - however this prevents overheating. Much lighter than belt fed machine guns; the Enfield Automatic will serve the next generation of Tommies in the trenches. The ML 3inch mortar is able to provide effective close artillery support while being portable."
 ENG_support_weapons4: "Enfield-Automatic Mk V & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons4_desc: "As the war drags on; improvements to existing models are constantly being made. The Mk V variant of the Enfield-Automatic features a telescopic sight and an improved cooling system. The ML 4.2 inch mortar is a heavy mortar. Quite heavy but deadly, the mortar requires to be towed in order for it to be brought to the battlefield."
 ENG_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "No.1 MC Mk 1"
 ENG_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The latest development in British ingenuity, the Mark 1 Machine-Carbine is a fully automatic sub-machine gun. A successful and reliable design; the Mark 1 features a steady rate of fire and is quite light, weighing at about 6 pounds (2.7 kg), making it perfect for close-quarters combat."
 ENG_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "No.11 MR MK IV"
 ENG_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The MK IV variant of the MR Mk 1 \"MR4 for short\" represents the latest technological advancements in warfare. The MK IV variant sees improvements to recoil and stability due to the tradition of the British Army on marksmanship. The gas-operated British machine rifle uses .280 British cartridges."
 ENG_night_vision: "Jack the Ripper"
 ENG_night_vision_desc: "Darkness has always been one of humankind's greatest enemies. The latest developments in Imperial College of Engineering have changed this by creating a top-secret infrared night vision scope. Nicknamed the \"Jack the Ripper\", the device allows for reconnaissance and operations under cover of darkness."

 ENG_train_equipment_2_desc: "After Robert Riddle's assignment to the Ministry of Supply, he quickly saw to designing several classes of locomotives that prioritise low cost over service life, able to be quickly produced. The modified Class 48F became the Class 90F, incorporating a number of changes. Extensive modifications were made to the boiler and fireboxes to use copper, along with simplifications to the valve gears. Welding was also implemented gradually into the construction of both the locomotives and tenders. The highly simplified production methods allowed for a large number of BR Class 90F to be built cheaply and rapidly."

 ENG_train_equipment_3_short: "BR Class 135MTA"
 ENG_train_equipment_3_desc: "Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern Region, Oliver Bulleid, believed that normal locomotives operating in the region would be easily taken out by any incoming hostile aircraft. The Class 135MTA would be his answer, a class of air-smoothed 4-6-2 Pacific steam locomotives, designed with redundancies in mind and armoured with two inches of armour plating over the boiler, wheels and cab. The class would be nicknamed 'Spam Cans' by their crews due to the air smoothed armour casing."

 #Infantry Equip

 IMP_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Long, Ross Mk III"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Ross Mk III"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."
 IMP_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk V"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the loyal Dominions only had access to one arsenal capable of producing its service rifle. Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 IMP_infantry_equipment_2: "Carbine, Machine, Owen Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Gun"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 IMP_infantry_equipment_3: "Rifle, Self-Loading, Long Branch Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 IMP_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 IMP_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 IMP_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 IMP_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 IMP_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 IMP_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 IMP_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 IMP_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 IMP_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 IMP_night_vision: "Tabby Scope"
 IMP_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 IMP_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Machine, Thompson Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States."
 IMP_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Carbine, Machine, Lanchester Mk I"
 IMP_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 IMP_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Commando, De Lisle Mk I"
 IMP_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "What began as a private venture by engineer William Godfray de Lisle soon caught the attention of the RCMP's Special Branch looking to equip agents with improved weaponry. The De Lisle carbine is, essentially, a shortened SMLE converted to .45 ACP, a subsonic cartridge with an integrated suppressor. The suppressor and ammunition together produced as little as 85.5 decibels when firing, making it very suitable for commando operations."

 IMP_armored_car_equipment_2_short: "Rhino"
 IMP_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "With the success of the Rover under its belt, the Ruskin Motor Bodies company designed the Rhino in response to an Australasian government request for a substantially heavier armoured car built upon the CMP chassis. Though substantial changes were made to that CMP chassis, after much work the Rhino was born, and with substantial interchangeability of parts with other CMP-based designs to boot."
 IMP_armored_car_at_equipment: "Ruskin Hippo"
 IMP_armored_car_at_equipment_short: "Hippo"
 IMP_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "To accommodate a substantially larger gun, the Rhino's coaxial machine had to be removed and its turret slightly enlarged. The 'Hippo' as this model has been designated, proved to be quite the headache for its design team, as these changes caused the already heavy vehicle to run into weight issues like its predecessors which had to be slowly worked out prior to the vehicle's adoption."
