##Char Intro
 POLITICS_AGRAVAIN_DESC: "King Arthur's right arm, Agravain, is the key figure for the stable existence of the Knights of the Round Table. With the strategy and the iron fist to maintain the stability of the country's internal affairs and diplomacy, Agravain is the person who is willing to do dirty work. However, although he is full of suspicions about other Knights, his loyalty to King Arthur is undeniable."

 POLITICS_ARTURIA_PENDRAGON_DESC: "In Britain, which has a deep monarchy tradition, King Arthur's status in the country is unparalleled. Although the main ethnic group in Britain today is the Anglo-Saxon who King Arthur fought in the past, King Arthur will still guard her new people. For her, it is the responsibility of the monarch to guard the daily life of the British people compared to the artificially constructed concept of nationality and ethnicity. This Britain, of course, also includes the colonies of the British Empire in the world."
 
 POLITICS_ANIMUSPHERE_DESC: "The Animusphere family occupies one of the twelve monarchs of the Clock Tower, and Olga-Marie, who inherited the inheritance of the father, became one of the most influential politicians of the clock tower, and at the same time, the celestial body of Clock Tower, In fact, the plan for an artificial celestial body has been placed on her desk. The Animusphere family is known for its controlling energy industry, and there are rumors that its holding of so much energy is aimed at a large secret research project called "Chaldeas", Professor Lev, another member of Clock Tower, was also thought participating."

 POLITICS_GRAY_DESC: "$ENG_gray_yarg$ is a student of classroom El-Melloi, a member of the Clock Tower, but more importantly, she is a distant relative of King Arthur. In Camelot-London's dual system, Gray played an extremely important middleman role. As the representative of the king is in the clock tower, Gray can successfully coordinate the size conflict between Round Table and Clock Tower. At the same time, Gray is the organizer of a secret research project named “Rhongomyniad” and is directly responsible to King Arthur himself."

 eng_core.1.title: "Uneasy Sailing"
 eng_core.1.desc: "In the aftermath of the Great War, no matter how much effort Her Majesty and the Knights put into consolidating the foundations of the Sunset Empire, the nation became irreversibly weary of military operations abroad, resulting in a strong civil rights movement to limit armaments, especially the army, which was reinstated with the title of "Royalty". The Army, which had been reinstated with the title "Royal". \nThe Clock Tower aristocrat, the Celestial Monarch $ENG_marisbury_animusphere$ successfully exploited this trend, and came to power under the slogan of peace and welfare, investing heavily in a number of welfare organisations to eliminate civil dissatisfaction, and the only one who suffered damage was the Royal Army, which had already been cut down heavily, and whose military spending was at an all-time low in the post-war period, a move which was also highly appreciated by the civil society. Highly appreciated, indeed most of our citizens no longer wish to see an army of millions of men. \n the present time, when the world situation remains relatively peaceful, $ENG_marisbury_animusphere$'s reign should continue for a long time, unless..."

 eng_core.2.title: "Appointment of a new Prime Minister"
 eng_core.2.desc: "After the assassination of $ENG_marisbury_animusphere$, several candidates were put forward by the Parliament at Westminster, and, probably due to a combination of emotional and political considerations, Her Majesty did not choose a Conservative, but appointed the daughter of the former Prime Minister, $ENG_olga_marie_arsimilat_animusphere$ as the next Prime Minister. After a brief funeral the new prime minister held a ceremony of office, vowing to fulfil her father's legacy."

A more outrageous but widely circulated theory is that $ENG_james_moriarty$ found out about $ENG_marisbury_animusphere$'s backstabbing and killed him, however this has not been confirmed by the person involved, $ENG_james_moriarty$."

In the underground structure of this giant research facility, the construction team was suddenly attacked by a fully restrained humanoid monster, but fortunately, the contract had specified this type of situation, and the soldiers accompanying the team used machine guns to kill it, and no other similar presence has been found in the subsequent series of firefights."

 eng_core.5.desc: "The Chaldean Research Centre's Antarctic base is in operation, and it looks like it's an international research centre run by the official public of [ENG.GetNameDefCap], but in fact, in its subterranean core, according to the drawings of the $ENG_marisbury_animusphere$, we have reproduced the planet's "dynamic model". \n But... What does it actually do? The $ENG_marisbury_animusphere$ never revealed to anyone what it was made for or how it was used, not even her daughter. And the cost of keeping the device running is considerable; the Navy already has a strong opinion of the ongoing fuel resupply trips to the vicinity of the South Pole, and rumours of the like gradually reached the ears of the Clock Tower executives, with talk of the Chaldean facility's labour of love increasing at a time when rearmament needs to be reorganised."

 eng_core.6.title: "Bills of National Conscription"
 eng_core.6.desc: "The most important issue covered by the various bills is about conscription. The Conservative government has announced that it will be planning a massive national conscription. However, there are members of the Conservative faction who are very concerned about this and would suggest a more restrictive conscription programme - which would still upset the public, but at least it wouldn't lead to violent protests, and might get some support from Socialists and Libertarians in the drafting of the bill."
 eng_core.6.a: "We said it's a full draft, we have to make it complete."
 eng_core.6.b: "Maybe a draft with some restrictions would be better."

 eng_core.7.title: "Bills of National Conscription"
 eng_core.7.desc: "The most important issue addressed by the various bills is about conscription. The liberal government has promised its popular countrymen that there will be no conscription. However, there are some in the party who agree with the Conservatives that [ENG.GetName]'s manpower reserves are indeed painfully low, and a little commitment to change might bring agreement with the Conservatives on the bill. Though this will almost certainly be met with accusations of "betrayal" and may even lead to another batch of defections from the House of Commons."

During an inspection close to the front line, his lot was attacked by enemy tanks, and whether out of bravery or to prove a point, $ENG_kayneth_el_melloi_archibald$ decided to fight alongside the frontline soldiers.

The Queen's chief advisors, $ENG_myrddin_wyllt$ and $ENG_morgan_le_fay$, filed a motion of no-confidence against $ENG_kayneth_el_melloi_archibald$ for his continued policy of appeasement during his administration, even though over the past years $ENG_kayneth_el_melloi_archibald$ has been a member of the government.

 eng_morgan.2.desc: "Various members of parliament have today strongly spoken out to support the Her Majersty's plans to marry Mrs. $ENG_morgan_le_fay$, rousing a number of their peers to their cause. Political opposition to the Her Majersty's marriage has thus decreased notably."
 eng_morgan.2.a: "What do politicians know about love, anyway."

 eng_morgan.3.title: "Upper Classes Support Marriage"
 eng_morgan.3.desc: "Notable individuals among the aristocracy have, in none too gentle terms, made clear their suppport with the prospect of the Her Majersty's marrying. The disdain her majersty appears to be treating tradition and ceremony with appears to have offended a great many of the most powerful individuals in the nation, but under the pressure of the Knights of the Round Table, they couldn't voice any objections."
 eng_morgan.3.a: "They are just jealous she has found love."

 eng_morgan.4.title: "Working Classes Support Marriage"
 eng_morgan.4.desc: "Support for the Her Majersty appears to be growing among the lower classes of the people. They not only see anything wrong with the Her Majersty marrying a 'relative', but even seem to adore the fairytale-esque story of a 'true-lover' winning the heart of Her Majersty and marrying into royalty."
 eng_morgan.4.a: "A winning formula for a novel, surely."

 eng_morgan.5.title: "$ENG_artoria_pendragon$ Holds Radio Speech"
 eng_morgan.5.desc: "Her Majersty has at last managed to persuade the government to allow her to make a radio speech, illustrating what she refers to as 'her side of the story'. She has expressed hopes that this will allow the people to better understand why she feels she must act as she does."
 eng_morgan.5.a: "It turns out 'his side of the story' was pretty convincing."

 eng_morgan.6.title: "The gender of $ENG_artoria_pendragon$?"
 eng_morgan.6.desc: "The gender of $ENG_artoria_pendragon$ is very strange, some people think she is a man but others think she is a woman, although $ENG_artoria_pendragon$ thinks she is a woman, but people prefer to think of her as a symbol and do not care who she is. As a result, the pronoun for $ENG_artoria_pendragon$ in newspapers, news and radio is often "he". This is not a problem for $ENG_artoria_pendragon$ herself. Of course, $ENG_artoria_pendragon$'s advisors and supporters will make him/her a perfect icon whether he/she wants to or not. For example, $ENG_myrddin_wyllt$ often pays to have $ENG_william_shakespeare$ publish chivalric novels, and I've heard that he's recently been tossing around a novel titled "Divine Realm of the Round Table - Camelot"."
 eng_morgan.6.a: ""Er, is that the case?""

 eng_morgan.7.title: "Red Prydwen"
 eng_morgan.7.desc: "Unfortunate news from the outskirts of London, our Crown Princess $ENG_medraut_pendragon$ has been sneaking out again in her car, the Red Prydwen, and even after drinking and parties, and as fate would have it she's crashed the car into a wall, but fortunately she's not too far behind. Except that it sent the circulation of London's gossip papers soaring, with news unfavourable to the royal family everywhere."

 eng_morgan.7.b: "\"Are you that lucky?\""

 eng_morgan.8.title: "$ENG_medraut_pendragon$ flight around the world"
 eng_morgan.8.desc: "Famous pilot $ENG_medraut_pendragon$, well known as the Crown Prince of [ENG.GetName], has successfully completed her round-the-world flight with her navigator $ENG_avalon_pendragon$.\n After the panic brought on by her disappearance for a short time off the uncharted waters of the Pacific Ocean called SE.RA.PH., the plane was accident-free and continued to fly. Their Supermarine Spitfire made an exciting landing in Camelot this morning.\n A ceremony will be organised for this purpose next week, where the Prime Minister and the Queen will congratulate $ENG_medraut_pendragon$ himself on this heroic deed."
 eng_morgan.8.a: "\"It looks like it's strong\""

 eng_morgan.9.title: "Former King George dies"
 eng_morgan.9.desc: "In the midst of the World War that was sweeping the world and the British Empire, former King George was plotting peace with Germany in private as the war of 1917 reached a stalemate. Of course this move was discovered by Parliament and the wartime Cabinet, so he and the royal family were placed under house arrest, and with the operation of $ENG_myrddin_wyllt$ and other supporters of $ENG_artoria_pendragon$, Parliament agreed to crown $ENG_artoria_pendragon$ as King, though $ENG_artoria_pendragon$ must lead the war and lead [ENG.GetName] to victory. Eventually $ENG_artoria_pendragon$ decided to bypass the bloody trenches and declared war on Holland, defeating the damned Germans in a series of offensives. And after the war, members of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha family were politely sent to Bulgaria for the rest of their lives. Eventually, the expelled King failed to overcome his illness and died in his sleep, while his heir called himself Edward VIII and insisted on retaining his claim to the [ENG.GetName] throne."

And what do you think I am? We're wives. Do you understand? \n $ENG_artoria_pendragon$ said as she put her hand on the left side of $ENG_morgan_le_fay$'s face, which made her face slightly red and heat. And $ENG_morgan_le_fay$ suddenly righted $ENG_artoria_pendragon$'s shoulders and whispered-\n "What do you see on my face? Is it the legendary Fairy of the Lake, the Great Dodo that guards you, or the Witch that did you harm? Or is it the fireplace of Merlin and the unburnt sunset of Camlann?" \n said $ENG_medraut_pendragon$, glancing back with slight displeasure, as if in thought, while $ENG_artoria_pendragon$ paused for a moment, and said slowly- \n "No, I only see $ENG_morgan_le_fay$, the one who has supported me from the beginning of the most wonderful sister, and as for what you're saying, is nothing of my business. The legendary King Arthur is long dead, and there's only your dearest Artoria, understand? Can't figure out why we are in the times, but we're all together, and that's enough!"\n "Well, dear Artoria, you seem to understand the human heart a little bit, well, it's come to this, I must admit that I really like you!" \n Finally, $ENG_medraut_pendragon$ added \n "Who cares about those things in the past, I think enjoying the moment is all that matters, and also, don't keep using me as a light bulb.""
 eng_morgan.10.a: "\"Well, welcome home, $ENG_morgan_le_fay$ and $ENG_medraut_pendragon$!\""

 eng_morgan.14.desc: "Challenging accusations that she is simply [GER.GetLeader]'s imitators, Her Majersty made a rousing speech today. In it, she asserted the uniqueness and individuality of British Fascism, and stressed the distinction between his policies and those of the German dictator. She went on to conclude with powerful words: "no-one but a Briton shall hold sway over Britain!""
 eng_morgan.14.a: "Public reception seems to be rather good."

 eng_morgan.15.title: "March on Downing Street"
 eng_morgan.15.desc: "Our march on Downing Street was a tremendous success, and under the immediate pressure of the people, the parliaments had no choice but to call for immediate elections. These were a clear victory for the Right, and, with the Queen's blessing, $ENG_morgan_le_fay$ is currently forming his cabinet. In a statement earlier today, the new Prime Minister already announced sweeping economic reforms and a new approach to European diplomacy.\nIn the meantime, dissent among the Dominions appear to be at an all-time high, and calls for independence have never been louder. The next few months will prove to be of momentous importance for the Empire."

 eng_morgan.18.title: "Parliament Suspended"
 eng_morgan.18.desc: "Exerting royal prerogative, [ENG.GetLeader] has taken the unprecedented move of suspending the Parliament and establishing a military government. Though, on the surface, the queen is acting through the Royal Prime Minister and her cabinet, it is clear that the Royals are now firmly - even if unofficially - in charge of the country. The queen's action is widely seen as one born of emergency, and a temporary measure intended to get [ENG.GetName] through the war. Demonstrations against the queen were half-hearted and quickly put down by security forces."
 eng_morgan.18.a: "A bold move, your Majesty."

In the wake of the Great Depression, the impact of the economic crisis caused Ireland to raise tariffs, severely damaging our economic interests. Given our personal relationship with $IRE_bazett_fraga_mac_remitz$ and the prestige of $ENG_artoria_pendragon$, it might be possible for us to reintegrate Ireland into the United Kingdom system, but this would undoubtedly lead to political conflict.

And we only need mutual security with the two countries to maintain this interest from being broken by other outside challengers. \n Compared to a clandestine naval race or a possible Pacific-Atlantic naval war, the restoration of the old open-door order is a very peaceful and cost-effective option, and our economic volume will certainly be able to dominate locally under the free-trade system."

 eng_for_imd.1.desc: "It has come to our attention that [From.GetNameDef] is supporting Imperial Loyalists in our country. If left unopposed, their subversive activities may well culminate in a full-blown civil war!"

 eng_for_imd.2.title: "[From.GetName] Moves to Secure Dominions"
 eng_for_imd.2.desc: "The new [From.GetAdjective] government has announced their intention to crush any dissent among their Dominions with military force, if necessary. Though their army would be stretched too thinly to do this all throughout the Empire, they clearly intend to try."

 eng_for_imd.3.title: "[From.GetName] Enforces Martial Law"
 eng_for_imd.3.desc: "Having deployed their forces in our mainland, the [From.GetAdjective] government has now announced martial law, suspending the government temporarily."

 eng_for_imd.4.desc: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has now begun to spread extensive ideological propaganda, using the martial law to suppress the media."

 eng_for_imd.5.title: "[From.GetName] Replaces Government"
 eng_for_imd.5.desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap], with the support of our people, has now disbanded our government altogether, and called for new elections. These have been nothing but a farce, with a loyalist government winning a landslide victory."
 eng_for_imd.5.a: "How dare th-- I mean, Rule Britannia!"

 eng_for_imd.6.title: "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] needs our support"
 eng_for_imd.6.desc: "After take his throne, [ENG.GetLeader] has delivered a speech to all the dominations and ask us to unite and support his rule. However, Britain is never a democratic nation now, which means we will lose some of our automony if we chose to stay."

 eng_for_imd.8.title: "[From.GetName] Proclaims Independence"
 eng_for_imd.8.desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has informed us that they cannot agree with the ideological path we have chosen, and that therefore they see no other option but to secede from the Empire."
 eng_for_imd.8.a: "We shall see how long that lasts."

 ##9-15TODO
 eng_for_imd.9.title: "IEDC Created"
 eng_for_imd.9.desc: "The Imperial Economic Development Council has been formed in order to foster greater economic cooperation within the [ENG.GetFactionName]. At the [Root.GetAdjective] government's direction, members of the [ENG.GetFactionName] may be invited into the IEDC, where they will be prompted - once a year - to make an investment of political power into its pool, and investment that gains them access to the IEDC's advisors. That pooled political power is spent by the head of the IEDC to invest back into its members."
 eng_for_imd.9.a: "An excellent initiative!"

 eng_for_imd.10.title: "Invitation to the IEDC"
 eng_for_imd.10.desc: "A delegation from the [From.GetAdjective] government arrived today to formally invite [Root.GetNameDef] to join the IEDC - the Imperial Economic Development Council. The IEDC was created to foster greater economic cooperation within the [ENG.GetFactionName], with yearly (and voluntary) contributions of political power which are invested back in member nations at the discretion of [From.GetNameDef]. There are those in the government who express concern whether [Root.GetNameDef] would actually see a return for its investment, seeing as [From.GetNameDef] could simply decide to invest everything in itself, but considering donations are voluntary it seems like that would ensure a short life for the IEDC."
 eng_for_imd.10.a: "We should Join IEDC"
 eng_for_imd.10.b: "We have no interest in the IEDC"

 eng_for_imd.11.title: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Join"
 eng_for_imd.11.desc: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has seen the wisdom of our offer and agreed to join the IEDC, including an initial investment of £pol_power [?From.iedc_contribution] Political Power. The first [From.GetAdjective] economists and engineers have already begun to arrive in [Root.GetNameDef]."
 eng_for_imd.11.a: "Excellent!"

 eng_for_imd.12.title: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Join"
 eng_for_imd.12.desc: "Perhaps seeing the [ENG.GetFactionName] as unable to impact its economy in any meaningful way, or simply not trusting the [Root.GetAdjective] government to administer its investments, [From.GetNameDef] has turned down our offer and refused to join the IEDC."
 eng_for_imd.12.a: "Disappointing"

 eng_for_imd.13.title: "Leaving the IEDC"
 eng_for_imd.13.desc: "As we are no longer a member of the [ENG.GetFactionName], it follows that we can no longer remain part of the IEDC. Already our engineers and advisors are leaving IEDC."
 eng_for_imd.13.a: "So be it!"

 eng_for_imd.14.title: "IEDC Shut Down"
 eng_for_imd.14.desc: "Without any membership in the organisation, the IEDC has finally elected to disband. There were a few protests on the board, those who said the IEDC could still prove valuable even if it was only coordinating efforts within [Root.GetNameDef] and not within the entire alliance, but for most it was clear that the IEDC had fallen short of its mission."
 eng_for_imd.14.a: "Unfortunate"

 eng_for_imd.15.title: "The Foundation of the ISAC"
 eng_for_imd.15.desc: "While the [ENG.GetFactionName] and our membership within it is, theoretically, of a purely military nature, the reality is far more complex than that. One of the legacies of the Great War was the advent of mass mobilisation - the consolidation of large swathes of potentially useful sectors of society into an apparatus designed to aid the war effort. The field of technology was included in this - in the efforts to break the trench warfare of the Western Front, military technology created bold new inventions such as landships in the hopes of finally turning the tide. As result of mobilisation such as this, the line between civilian and military resources became somewhat blurred - and the recent growth of ever-present international tensions have ushered the start of a global arms race, something that nobody can afford to be left behind in.\nTo this end, [ENG.GetNameDef] has established an Imperial Scientific and Academic Council - an organisation intended to unify and coordinate the [ENG.GetFactionName]'s research efforts across borders, allowing for the swift spread of major technological breakthroughs between member states and the elimination of some wasteful duplicate work. As a member of the alliance, we have been invited to participate in the initiative and reap the benefits alongside our allies, a prospect that has generated much excitement within our scientific community."
 eng_for_imd.15.a: "A wonderful initiative!"

 eng_for_imd.16.title: "[From.GetName] Accepts"
 eng_for_imc.16.desc: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has notified us that they agree to our proposal of to support us. They have vowed to do so immediately."
 eng_for_imc.16.a: "They do their duty to the Empire."

 eng_for_imc.17.title: "[From.GetName] Rejects"
 eng_for_imc.17.desc: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has rejected to loyal to us. They fear that tynnary of [ENG.GetLeader] will harm them."
 eng_for_imc.17.a: "They think only of themselves!"

 ENG_infantry_equipment_0_short: "No.1 Mk III"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mk III has served the Tommy since 1907, an iconic weapon of the Weltkrieg. The SMLE Mk III came with the 1907 Pattern bayonet and a simplified rear sight arrangement, and a fixed charger guide. During the Weltkrieg, demand outstripped supply and thus many copies of the Mk III comes with the deletion of the magazine cutoff."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle No.4 Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_short: "No.4 Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_desc: " After the threat of the great war it became apparent that the No.3 Enfield was not fit for urban combat.\" Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.In 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, and a simplified bolt system.\"The No.4 is the newest member in the family of Lee-Enfield rifles. While similar to its predecessors, the No.4 is stronger and easier to produce. A bit heavier due to its barrel; an interesting fact about the No.4 is that it comes with an aperture sight that is set at increments of 100 yds (91m); calibrated for 200-1,300 yards (183-1189 metres)."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2: "No.2 Machine-Carbine Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2_short: "No.2 MC Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_2_desc: " With the future of warfare gravitating towards hand-held automatic weapons and the clouds of war looming in Europe once more, the technicians at the RSAF have created a new submachine gun. Light and portable, the No.2 machine carbine is ideally suited for urban operations and medium to close-range combat."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3: "No.9 Machine-Rifle Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3_short: "No.9 MR Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_3_desc: " Experience fighting against German troops armed with the Maschinenkarabiner 44 and comparisons with French designs led Charles Babbage at RSAF to create a new bullpup rifle. Capable of switching firing modes from semi-automatic to fully automatic; the No.9 rifle will provide the Tommy with extensive firepower."
 ENG_infantry_at: "Boys Anti-Tank Rifle"
 ENG_infantry_at_desc: "Often nicknamed the 'Elephant Gun' due to its size and large bore, the Boys Anti-Tank rifle can fire a 60g AP projectile at 747 m/s. However, despite the weapon's recoil slide and rubber cushioned buttpad, the recoil of the weapon was said to be painful, frequently causing neck strains and bruised shoulders."
 ENG_infantry_at2: "Anti-armoured Device MK2"
 ENG_infantry_at2_desc: " The anti-armoured device MK2 is one of the newest tinkerments developed by the Imperial College of Engineering. With an effective firing range of 115 yard, the MK2 will be able to knock out and pierce the heaviest of the Siegfried's panzers."
 ENG_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons_desc: "The Vickers MG and Stokes mortar were iconic weapons of the British Army during the Weltkrieg. Following the revolution and the civil war; large quantities of these weapons still exist in the arsenals of the RSAF. Though outclassed in this day and age; they can still be used effectively."
 ENG_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 ENG_support_weapons3: "Enfield-Automatic Mk IIIB & ML 3 inch mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons3_desc: " The Enfield-Automatic Mk IIIB is another creation of the RSAF. Seeking a replacement for the Vickers and Lewis; the Enfield-Automatic is magazine fed which reduces its rate of fire - however this prevents overheating. Much lighter than belt fed machine guns; the Enfield Automatic will serve the next generation of Tommies in the trenches. The ML 3inch mortar is able to provide effective close artillery support while being portable."
 ENG_support_weapons4: "Enfield-Automatic Mk V & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 ENG_support_weapons4_desc: "As the war drags on; improvements to existing models are constantly being made. The Mk V variant of the Enfield-Automatic features a telescopic sight and an improved cooling system. The ML 4.2 inch mortar is a heavy mortar. Quite heavy but deadly, the mortar requires to be towed in order for it to be brought to the battlefield."
 ENG_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "No.1 MC Mk 1"

The modified Class 48F became the Class 90F, incorporating a number of changes. Extensive modifications were made to the boiler and fireboxes to use copper, along with simplifications to the valve gears. Welding was also implemented gradually into the construction of both the locomotives and tenders. The highly simplified production methods allowed for a large number of BR Class 90F to be built cheaply and rapidly."

 #Infantry Equip

 IMP_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Long, Ross Mk III"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Ross Mk III"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."
 IMP_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk V"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the loyal Dominions only had access to one arsenal capable of producing its service rifle. Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 IMP_infantry_equipment_2: "Carbine, Machine, Owen Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Gun"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 IMP_infantry_equipment_3: "Rifle, Self-Loading, Long Branch Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 IMP_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 IMP_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 IMP_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 IMP_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 IMP_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 IMP_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 IMP_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 IMP_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 IMP_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 IMP_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 IMP_night_vision: "Tabby Scope"
 IMP_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of us tech developer. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 IMP_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Machine, Thompson Mk I"
 IMP_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States."
 IMP_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Carbine, Machine, Lanchester Mk I"
 IMP_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 IMP_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Commando, De Lisle Mk I"
 IMP_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "What began as a private venture by engineer William Godfray de Lisle soon caught the attention of the RCMP's Special Branch looking to equip agents with improved weaponry. The De Lisle carbine is, essentially, a shortened SMLE converted to .45 ACP, a subsonic cartridge with an integrated suppressor. The suppressor and ammunition together produced as little as 85.5 decibels when firing, making it very suitable for commando operations."

 IMP_armored_car_equipment_2: "Ruskin Rhino"
 IMP_armored_car_equipment_2_short: "Rhino"
 IMP_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "With the success of the Rover under its belt, the Ruskin Motor Bodies company designed the Rhino in response to an Australasian government request for a substantially heavier armoured car built upon the CMP chassis. Though substantial changes were made to that CMP chassis, after much work the Rhino was born, and with substantial interchangeability of parts with other CMP-based designs to boot."
 IMP_armored_car_at_equipment: "Ruskin Hippo"
 IMP_armored_car_at_equipment_short: "Hippo"
 IMP_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "To accommodate a substantially larger gun, the Rhino's coaxial machine had to be removed and its turret slightly enlarged. The 'Hippo' as this model has been designated, proved to be quite the headache for its design team, as these changes caused the already heavy vehicle to run into weight issues like its predecessors which had to be slowly worked out prior to the vehicle's adoption."

 IMP_light_tank_equipment_1_desc: "The Vickers Mark E entered limited service with the Canadian Army in 1932 with the designation 'A4' as a stopgap tankette while more advanced light tanks were developed. It was given the rather ironic nickname 'Reliant' for its simultaneous reliability in harsh terrain and tendency to breakdown randomly in seemingly innocuous situations."
