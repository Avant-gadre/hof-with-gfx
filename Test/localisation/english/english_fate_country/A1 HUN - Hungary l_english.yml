 HUN_Disposal_of_Batori: "Disposal of Bathory"
 HUN_Disposal_of_Batori_desc: "The former Regency faction should be handled with care, many of them are outstanding figures who cannot be replaced, and as long as there are no extreme cases of death or death perhaps Bathory may show his allegiance to the new regime -- -- and of course ultimately it still depends on what we want."

 HUN_Hungarian_labor_front_desc: "Unions loyal to the Jewish Bolsheviks will be outlawed and the Labor Front organization, under direct state control, will exist as the only legal union in the country.

 HUN_Incorporated_militia: "The Collection of Militias"
 HUN_Incorporated_militia_desc: "The various right-wing militia forces active across the country have long been a nuisance, and forcibly disbanding them is not a good option, so it's better to continue to use their patriotism to incorporate them into government work by hand. The hunters, a paramilitary group loyal to Bathory, can expand and gradually grow into a reserve of the regular army and \"do the dirty work\"."

 HUN_balkan_socialist_federation_desc: "Ideas of a Balkan Federation have been floated around socialist circles for decades, but never got a chance to be implemented - until today.

##Events
 more_hun.1.t: "The composition of the Bathory regime"
 more_hun.1.d: "Countess Elisabeth Bathory succeeded in uniting the divided left and right wings in 1919 to resist the advances of the Little Entente, and after the war, as expected by the community, the political scene was again divided, barely holding on by the glory of victory. \n\nBathory mainly relies on the \"moderate right\" in the majority of the government to implement authoritarian rule, after a decade of constitutional break in the ruling coalition has been a lot of opposition to her voice. But this was less of a problem than the extreme right. After the Hungarian Communist Party's power was restricted, the National Will Party, founded by social nationalist Ferenc Szalács, a retired military officer who advocated \"class cooperation\", quickly filled the Communist Party's influence and, with the support of the cavalry general Attila, absorbed several far-right parties that had been scattered and were strong enough to launch a march on Budapest."
 more_hun.1.a: "How do you guys just know how to give me trouble?!" 
 more_hun.1.b: "But isn't it the spirit of Mazars that our people have survived to this day?" 
 more_hun.1.c: "Maybe it's time to put the communists out to restrain them."  
 
 more_hun.2.t: "German economic ties"
 more_hun.2.d: "The economy was never easy, especially since Hungary is still under economic blockade by the old Entente, and who told us we never signed a single word on the bullshit peace treaty? \n\nOur biggest trading partner at the moment is [GER.GetName], which also suffered from the Entente, and the long-fixed trade with Germany has caused our economy to be highly dependent on [GER.GetName], while at the same time fuelling the arrogance of the pro-German group represented by Ferenc."
 more_hun.2.a: "Now there is only one way to make good use of trade with Germany."
 more_hun.2.b: "This is a symbol of German-Hungarian friendship!"  
 more_hun.2.c: "Get some nationalization to counter German economic control."

 more_hun.3.t: "Great Hungary"
 more_hun.3.d: "Not an inch of Greater Hungary is superfluous! Hungarians who don't love their country don't deserve to be human! \n\nBut then again, our country is not a mono-ethnic country, there are Slovaks in the north, most of the area around Transylvania in the east is dominated by Dacians, and there are also Germans and Slavs mixed in the southern Banat belt, so it can be a real headache to deal with the relations between multiple ethnic groups."
 more_hun.3.a: "Let's take our time with this."
 more_hun.3.b: "Cooperation with some groups should be strengthened."  
 more_hun.3.c: "Affirmative action is a must!" 

 more_hun.4.t: "Diplomatic dilemma"
 more_hun.4.d: "Because of economic ties, our country is indeed currently firmly attached to [GER.GetName], which has led many people abroad to believe that [HUN.GetName] will correct the post-war pattern in concert with [GER.GetName] in the future no matter what. \n\n Perhaps this is only half right, we will indeed not bend to the bullshit rules set by the Allies, however allies are not necessarily [GER.GetName] Intelligence reports indicate that the Entente forces are nearing the end of their patience with the increasingly fanatical [ROM.GetName], and if [HUN.GetName] can prove its strength, some Entente members may ally with us out of practical necessity."
 more_hun.4.a: "We have to break the diplomatic dilemma no matter what."
 more_hun.4.b: "We will have to fix the old order no matter what!"  

 more_hun.5.t: "Army expansion"
 more_hun.5.d: "Our army has long adhered to the tradition of cavalry, which does not mean the old-fashioned horseback riding; in the new era cavalry should ride in armored vehicles and have submachine guns at hand instead of the obsolete saber. \n\n Unfortunately, our industry is temporarily unable to achieve large-scale motorization, and in the face of the mobilized Romanians will have to continue to expand the ranks of traditional infantry, perhaps a little extraordinary means should be tried?"
 more_hun.5.a: "Train a few infantry brigades."
 more_hun.5.b: "And mobilize the masses!"  
 
 more_hun.6.t: "Pal Pronay and $HUN_imre_kemeri_nagy$ asks to return to the army"
 more_hun.6.d: "There were some people who were very good at "repression", but they were always brutal in their methods, represented by the former cavalry officer Pall Prunet, whose tactics against the Communists during the turbulent years of 1919, when the political situation was not yet secure, effectively prevented further revolution. The revolution took place further, which, of course, gave Count Bathory a good excuse to dismiss him from the army. \n\nNow that the Dacians in the east are once again on the move, Prunet, instead of his ragged men, also supported by the cavalry general Attila, petitioning for reinstatement, might as well send them to Transylvania?"
 more_hun.6.a: "So be it."
 more_hun.6.b: "He'll never come back!"  

 more_hun.7.t: "The old business"
 more_hun.7.d: "It seems that Attila's promise that Pal Pronay would be a little more "peaceful" was purely an off-the-cuff remark, and the infamous Ragamuffins started to do what they wanted as soon as they arrived in Transylvania, and with the acquiescence of the local regular army, Prunet ordered mass executions of any "suspected collaborators The Ragamuffins, with the acquiescence of the local regular army, ordered mass executions of anyone suspected of "collaborating with the enemy," even razing a village outright. \n\nBut one has to admit that his move really worked, and the Dacian infiltration activity was clearly reduced compared to the mere implementation of the blockade policy ---- infiltrators turned their attention to reciprocal terrorist activities."
 more_hun.7.a: "Tell him to give me a break!"
 more_hun.7.b: "One way or the other!" 

 more_hun.8.t: "One year anniversary of the death of Gyula Gömbös"
 more_hun.8.d: "Today is the first anniversary of the death of Hungarian nationalist camp bigwig Günbosz Gyulo, and from the streets of Budapest to the countryside around Szeged people have spontaneously held up huge pictures of him to start a commemorative parade. Since 1919, Gönbosch had been in charge of internal and external affairs as prime minister of Regent Bathory, and it was he who had been placing a large number of his cronies in the government, thus forming a large right-wing network inside and outside the government. \n\nBut as a workaholic his health was not good, so he died on a trip to [GER.GetName], but unfortunately his death did not cause a split among the nationalists, and the more radical "social nationalist" Salahi Ferencz formed an alliance with the cavalry general Attila and continued to influence the Bartoli's government."
 more_hun.8.a: "Out of courtesy, Bathory decided to attend the march to mark the occasion."
 more_hun.8.b: "Too lazy to go!" 

 more_hun.9.t: "Sepp Janko's proposal"
 more_hun.9.d: ""If you still want some combat aircraft, I can help through my friends in Berlin, and..." Zep Janko, the representative of the Germanic ethnic group in Banet, paused slightly. "The Fatherland side is more than willing to send technical personnel to provide overall guidance to our troops." \n\\n "So generous, what is the cost?" \n\n "Huh?! The price?" Janko looked very surprised. "Your Excellency, you are overthinking it, the motherland has always been grateful for your policy of protecting the Germanic ethnicity, and all of this additional assistance requested in my name is free of charge." \n\nFree planes and advisors did not seem to pull Bathory out of his hesitant silence, and Janko and fellow National Will Party leader Salahi Ferencz could only sit across the table and wait patiently, finally..."
 more_hun.9.a: ""Then you go ahead and try.""
 more_hun.9.b: ""Forget it."" 

 more_hun.10.t: "Tensions in Transylvania"
 more_hun.10.d: "Banet Commissioner Sepp Janko has recently reported that the [HUN.GetName] army is being urgently expanded, and combined with the intelligence coming from the Darnic flag captain on the [ROM.GetName] side it appears that the Dacians will soon be making their move. We have already reached a political alliance with the largest nationalist party in the region, so perhaps we can use this opportunity to propose to [HUN.GetName] and strengthen our forces."
 more_hun.10.a: ""Let Janko try.""
 more_hun.10.b: ""Is that necessary?"" 

 more_hun.11.t: "[HUN.GetName] wants us to support further"
 more_hun.11.d: "It seems that Janko's mission is complete, and the Tule Guard side will select about a hundred officers of the rank of captain, with Otto Skorzny and Schmeisser Gewer as the chief and deputy chiefs. Ten Stukas have also been allocated on the part of the \n\n Air Force, and all personnel will be sent to Budapest by air."
 more_hun.11.a: ""Let's leave immediately.""

 more_hun.12.t: "[GER.GetName] agreed to send aircraft with advisors"
 more_hun.12.d: "Germans called back to say they will land at Budapest airport tomorrow night, by definition..."
 more_hun.12.a: "Bathory should go to the airport to meet them."
 more_hun.12.b: "Too lazy to go!" 

 more_hun.13.t: "Callback from Janko"
 more_hun.13.d: "Sepp Janko reports that the proposal has been rejected and no amount of persuasion has resulted in the Regent's approval."
 more_hun.13.a: "How stubborn."

 more_hun.14.t: "A concert?"
 more_hun.14.d: "As Bathory's biggest supporter, former Austro-Hungarian Admiral Horty Miklos has recently made an irresistible proposal ---- to hold a concert! That's right! That is, a concert in the Budapest Arena! Stirring music can uplift people! The ancient Greeks proved this long ago. \n\nAnd why is it said that it can not be refused, because the person who sings on stage is Bathory himself! The tune is our well-known divine song "I am a soldier of Bathory". It may be a little weird to have it sung by myself, but that doesn't matter! Let's set Budapest on fire!!!"
 more_hun.14.a: ""I'm going to let her tricolor flag fly~~""

 more_hun.15.t: "Kun Béla's speech"
 more_hun.15.d: "When the current policy began to stick, intentionally or unintentionally, to the Communist Party's claims, this group of ambitious people jumped out of their holes in the ground like bears that had smelled honey. Kuhn Bera, a Communist Party bigwig who had gained great momentum in the past, suddenly ignored the ban on party restrictions and came to deliver an inflammatory speech at a steel mill owned by our industrial giant Manfred Weiss. The \n\n police were already on their way to outlaw the speech, but they reported that they had just bumped into a militia belonging to the National Will Party, a group that was naturally ready to go for a smash."
 more_hun.15.a: ""Take both sides to the station!""

 more_hun.16.t: "Steel Mill Smash"
 more_hun.16.d: "Thanks to the connivance of the police, the raging left and right sides collided in front of the gates of the steel mill, and Kun Béla began to encourage his supporters to take up tools to confront the militia, and the commander on the opposite side certainly had no intention of backing down. \n\nSo what was the final outcome?"

 more_hun.17.d: "The connection between Kun Béla's Hungarian Communist Party and [SOV.GetName] was almost an open secret, and as the Communist Party began to show its face publicly again, some of the Communists who had fled to [SOV.GetName] in the past because of the restriction order returned, such as Rákosi Mátyás. The \n\n, a man considered to be a loyal follower of former [SOV.GetName] leader Jugashvili, has always been viewed by intelligence agencies as a higher threat than Kun Béla, and it is hard to imagine what such a man would do if he seized power.

Some schools with long-standing ties to the nationalists have begun to organize visits to the National Will Party headquarters at 60 András Street. \n\nIn the past the government seized the premises where the Hungarian Communist Party was raising the "Lenin boys", should this activity also be stopped now?"

 more_hun.37.t: "Deal with nationalists"
 more_hun.37.d: "In Bathory's eyes the Hungarian Communist Party has always been "defensible and controllable", these people may know a lot about revolution but not necessarily about Hungary, and by working with the other, more moderate Marxist faction represented by the Social Democratic Party could effectively split the leftist camp. \n\nHowever, the nationalist right wing that opposes it is another matter. These people, who claim to represent the "Magyar spirit", can accept the "Greater Hungarian Empire" but will never accept a real Donau Federation! If the current government starts to gradually reduce the nationalist content of the political atmosphere, there is no telling what these guys who talk without thinking will do."
 more_hun.37.a: "Unfortunately, They don't have much influence anymore." 
 more_hun.37.b: "The nationalists are enraged!" 
 
 more_hun.38.t: "March into Budapest"
 more_hun.38.d: ""How can you defeat your own strength! Raise the spirits of the enemy?!" "Bathory steps down!" The streets of Budapest today are filled with nationalists waving flags and shouting. At the center of the whirlpool, Bathory-Elisabeth, on the other hand, was watching the farce through binoculars with Admiral Horthy on the castle hill, and indeed in the forefront were Attila and Sarasch Ferenc, who had just emerged from the party building, with a group of armed soldiers led by General Demai Stoyoy and General Berefi Karolyi behind them. \n\nThe already not very peaceful demonstration soon developed into a violent clash, and Bathory decisively ordered the police, who were hidden in various places, to move out to prepare for a clean sweep of the group."
 more_hun.38.a: "The rioters were arrested." 
 more_hun.38.b: "The rioters have broken through the lines!"
 more_hun.38.c: "Rioters repulsed!" 
 
 more_hun.39.t: "That's it."
 more_hun.39.d: "As predicted, the nationalists started a riot in Budapest and were wiped out again, and now there is no one left to stop the Donau Federation plan from being implemented."
 more_hun.39.a: ""That's it.""

 more_hun.40.t: "What?!"
 more_hun.40.d: "It was too late when Bathory saw the vocal crowd breaking through a checkpoint to ascend Castle Hill, and Attila, who had rushed to the castle gates, couldn't wait for his entourage a hundred meters away and kicked open what appeared to be a heavy doorway..."
 more_hun.40.a: "Uhhhhh..."

 more_hun.41.t: "Civil War Clouds"
 more_hun.41.d: "To everyone's surprise, the march on Budapest failed, but the plotters retreated unscathed. The nationalists who retreated to the shores of Lake Ladoga and the Budapest regime began to mobilize their respective forces with the intention of a showdown, yet no one dared to actually do anything ---- Was this really necessary? Is it really necessary to bury the good that was gained by defeating [ROM.GetName] just for this?"
 more_hun.41.a: "The stalemate has seen more and more people start to support the Bathory government."  
 more_hun.41.b: "With the stalemate, more and more people are starting to support the nationalists."
 more_hun.41.c: "Salahi tried to ask German advisors to take out Bathory."

 more_hun.42.t: "Compromise"
 more_hun.42.d: "Increasingly seen by the public as traitors to the state, the nationalists chose to compromise with the Bathory government, with those involved in the riots being pardoned for their crimes but henceforth withdrawn from politics, and the Donau federal program continuing... \n\n hey... In fact, after all the turmoil these days, the federal plan has basically become the biggest political laughing stock of our country, and perhaps your Excellency... We... Want to be realistic?"
 more_hun.42.a: ""I'm not going to give up on that.""  
 more_hun.42.b: ""Hungary, can it only be Hungary?"" 

 more_hun.43.t: "Bathory resigned?"
 more_hun.43.d: "Bathory actually found a letter left by Admiral Horthy on his desk this morning, and the naval hero, long seen as a political ally, turned up at the right-wing base camp on Lake Ladoga as well. \n \n "What do you mean, 'those who know the time are the best'?! How dare you say that?!" Only after tearing the letter to pieces ruthlessly did Bathory see General Géza standing frozen outside the door, who frankly speaking was a representative of the Hungarian military, not necessarily on the same line as the Regency government, and was presumably here to leave a letter at the moment. \n\n which knew that Géza was more unexpected than expected, "Your Excellency, I do not think you can continue to perform the duties conferred by the Constitution now..."
 more_hun.43.a: ""Good! Then I'll roll!""
 more_hun.43.b: ""Good! Then I'll roll!" (then secretly picks up the phone)"

 more_hun.44.t: "The triumph of communism"
 more_hun.44.d: "Kun Béla had been waiting, but of course he didn't think it could end up like this, that the Regent, who had been persecuting the Communists, would personally call and ask for assistance from this side, on the condition that she would henceforth join the Communist Party and convert Hungary into a complete Communist regime. \n\nDoes this even need to be considered? After almost twenty years of waiting, now is the time! \n\nOnce the oath of membership read by the Regent herself was broadcast, Bolsheviks carrying red flags quickly filled the streets of Budapest. The countryside, which had been hostile to communism, did not look on with indifference this time either. The long work of the localist party members finally paid off, the peasants organized in groups to protest against the landlords, and the base of the right-wing forces began to disintegrate."
 more_hun.44.a: ""I didn't expect it to end up like this..."" 
 
 more_hun.45.t: "Janko's urgent telegram"
 more_hun.45.d: "At the moment the [SOV.GetName] political situation has fallen into a stalemate, someone has to go and open things up! I think the advisory group we left in [HUN.GetName] is such a force! \n\n Just in time, Barnet Commissioner Janko has just sent a letter on behalf of Hungarian national leader Salahi Ferencz, the National Will Party leader wants us to send a commando unit to behead Bathory."
 more_hun.45.a: ""Then let Skorzny do it!""
 more_hun.45.b: ""Can't take that chance! Withdraw the advisory group!""

 more_hun.46.t: "Operation Iron Fist"
 more_hun.46.d: "The chief of advisors, Skorzny, has long had an idea, in fact he and the advisory group led by deputy chief Gewel have been planning a course of action since the chaos began stranded at the German embassy in Budapest, for the moment Bathory has no intention of deporting this group of armed men, but who knows if tomorrow it will be because of Janko's relations with Berlin and thus sweeping them off their feet? The \n\n plan is very simple, tonight the inside man left in the city by the National Will Party will steal the German-aided tank number two from the warehouse, and when several tanks open fire in the city and try to storm Castle Hill, the advisory group will use the confusion caused to launch a surprise attack to capture Bathory alive!"
 more_hun.46.a: ""Check weapons! Time to move!""

 more_hun.47.t: "Operation Iron Fist"
 more_hun.47.d: "Late at night, the Germans were lurking in the nearest civilian residence on Castle Hill, and Skorzny was seemingly calmly pinching his watch waiting for the moment of action. Honestly the advisory group was too small, how was a group of light infantry supposed to take down the heavily guarded Castle Hill if the Hungarians on this side failed to create chaos? \n\n think what you want, the perennially indifferent face of Miss Gewell came running to report that..."
 more_hun.47.a: ""The Hungarians have got it.""   
 more_hun.47.b: ""The Hungarians didn't get the job done.""

 more_hun.48.t: "The next day"
 more_hun.48.d: "The citizens of Budapest woke up in the morning feeling only confused; the National Will Party, which had been driven out of the city a few days before, was now back in high spirits, and the Arrow Cross flag was now flying from 60 András Street all the way to the top of Castle Hill, and news of Bartoli's resignation was coming over the radio."
 more_hun.48.a: ""The sky has changed again.""

 more_hun.49.t: "A strong attack on Castle Hill"
 more_hun.49.d: "Bathory Elizabeth did not know what was coming for death, she just watched the battle at the bottom of the hill with binoculars with interest, the raiders were indeed not easy to deal with, the guard troops launched a counterattack surprisingly gave killed several people on a hasty retreat to the fortifications, and then a group of people in the back were pushing an anti-tank gun up to the front line to shell the civilian houses where the raiders were hiding. \n \n "This is really a disgrace, so that the old mother wants to personally down." The indifferent Bartoli said flatly while looking at the flustered Holti beside her, who somehow suddenly looked up at the sky with wide eyes."
 more_hun.49.a: ""Is there something .... up there?!!!""

 more_hun.50.t: "Berlin rejected it"
 more_hun.50.d: "The fate of Hungary can only be decided by the Hungarians themselves."

 more_hun.51.t: "Mass arrests of communists"
 more_hun.51.d: "Operation Chakhtis' first step was to "eradicate the communist threat", perhaps contrary to Bartoli's strategy of using the communist front nationalist groups all along, but only the wisest of leaders would have learned from the October Revolution that first this red viper must be cut off head! The \n\n Communist Party is obviously not going to sit back and wait for death, and in the face of the government's completely unrelenting strangulation, their choice is..."
 more_hun.51.a: "There's a revolution in Budapest!"
 more_hun.51.b: "The Communists are incapable of starting a revolution."

 more_hun.52.t: "Revolution"
 more_hun.52.d: "The Communist dogfight was unexpected by Bathory, could she organize an army to suppress it?"
 more_hun.52.a: "The crackdown failed and Bathory was arrested!"
 more_hun.52.b: "The revolution was suppressed."     
 more_hun.52.c: "The army, together with right-wing militias, suppressed the revolution."

 more_hun.53.t: "Mass arrests of nationalists"
 more_hun.53.d: "Operation Chakhtis' aim is to "purge extremism", and none of the far left and far right conspiring to seize power will escape! \n\n Compared to the communists, the nationalists, rooted in the core of the Hungarian nation, are more powerful. And now that the strong feelings of revenge triggered by the humiliation of being defeated by [ROM.GetName] have caused their power to expand rapidly, including a large number of people in the government army who have become sympathetic to the cause of the NYKP, the resistance to the arrest operation may be much greater than expected."
 more_hun.53.a: "The expected backlash has occurred."

 more_hun.54.t: "A hammer blow"
 more_hun.54.d: "Was it Castle Hill or 60 András Street that burned after the last chaos in Budapest?"
 more_hun.54.a: "The party headquarters of the National Will Party was destroyed."
 more_hun.54.b: "The right-wing forces took Castle Hill."

 more_hun.56.d: "Europeans know that [HUN.GetName] will definitely fight for Greater Hungary as long as he lives, perhaps we all have problems with [ROM.GetName] and his backers, in any case [HUN.GetName] diplomats came to our door and on behalf of [HUN.GetLeader] presented us with the The document is as expected hoping for support ---- for the next Transylvanian war. \n\nIf Greater Hungary is recovered, [HUN.GetName] can obviously be a good boost to our cause... But why did they have to come to us if they were really capable? There are people in the government who don't think [HUN.GetName] is worth supporting at all."

 more_hun.58.d: "[FROM.GetName] declined"
 more_hun.58.a: "Assholes!"

 more_hun.59.t: "The split in the Communist Party"
 more_hun.59.d: "After barely silencing all their opponents, the Communists had to face an even tougher problem ---- their own people. \n\nKun Béla was indeed the revolutionary vanguard of Hungary in 1919, yet the time after that the party was long under the effective control of Rajk Laszlo and János Kádár, who took a more rural approach more in keeping with Hungarian conditions. Now that László and Kádár have openly rejected various future collectivization lines and called on their followers to march, Rákosi, a good student of Jugashvili, is already preparing to mobilize force to remove the influence of the so-called "nativists". \n\nIf this were to further inflame the divisions, the country could face another upheaval and the opposing sides would have to try to find more outside help to "peacefully" crush their opponents. \n\nSo the former Regent Bathory is once again at the center of the storm, and the terms of her proposed deal are simple ---- continue to be the head of the line, regardless of whether the title is regent or secretary or other."
 more_hun.59.a: "The Bolshevik-following "Internationalists" made a deal with Bathory."

 HUN_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 HUN_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 HUN_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 HUN_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 HUN_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 HUN_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 HUN_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 HUN_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 HUN_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
 HUN_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
 HUN_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
 HUN_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a licence to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
 HUN_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Letov L.52"
 HUN_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "L.52"
 HUN_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

 HUN_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Praga E.51"
 HUN_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "E.51"
 HUN_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."
 HUN_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.31"
 HUN_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "WM.31"
 HUN_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arose over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."
 HUN_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.50"
 HUN_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "WM.50"
 HUN_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Avia F.39"
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "F.39"
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newer models were developed."
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š-50"
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š-50"
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero Vodochody A.300"
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "A.300"
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconnaissance aircraft."
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.311"
 HUN_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."
 HUN_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov L.11"
 HUN_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "L.11"
 HUN_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Based on a jet fighter design by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the L.11 adapted the design into a fast and light jet bomber for multiple roles, hoping to replace the Monarchy's fleet of older prop-driven tactical bombers."
 HUN_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero L.44"
 HUN_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "L.44"
