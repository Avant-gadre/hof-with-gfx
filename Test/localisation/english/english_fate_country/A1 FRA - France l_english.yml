 lr_france.19.t: "Hidden Events"
 lr_france.19.d: "Hidden Events"
 lr_france.19.a: "Hidden Events"

 lr_france.20.t: "A possibility of Mediterranean Alliance"
 lr_france.20.d: "It was the military conquest of our great emperor Napoleon I that brought the awakening of national consciousness to the Apennine Peninsula, so they should have allied with us... Well, naturally it's not that simple, and after a lot of things happen our relationship doesn't get so good. But one thing is certain, they proclaim Rome is just for seizing territory, and we could separate some meaningless colonies in this regard, and it would be good for both of us if it could form a military alliance."
 lr_france.20.a: "We can give them parts of West Africa and Somaliland."
 lr_france.20.b: "France is indivisible!"
 
 lr_france.21.t: "France hopes to offer thier colonies for an alliance"
 lr_france.21.d: "No matter how the British and French advertise themselves, they will firmly divide the positive African continent into two large pieces and hold it in their hands. Naturally our new empire must have a duel with them, but in terms of our strength, it is very troublesome to deal with a family. of. So the French emperor Napoleon I proposed that the eastern part of French West Africa and Somaliland be exchanged for our alliance with him, and at the same time he hinted that we would use this land to attack the Republic of Congo, which was independent from Belgium in recent years. This is not only a good opportunity to expand the colony, but also gives us military backing."
 lr_france.21.a: "A nice proposal."
 lr_france.21.b: "Then give us Savoy and Corsica too!" 
 
 lr_france.22.t: "They also want Savoy and Corsica..."
 lr_france.22.d: "It must be said that the wings of this group of Lombard barbarians have grown longer and more arrogant. Our friendly alliance proposal has turned into their opportunity to claim territory. Savoy and Corsica? ! What a joke? ! If it is necessary to say that there are indeed many Italians in these two areas, and it is indeed the Apennine land that was once merged into France, then ..."
 lr_france.22.a: "No way!"
 lr_france.22.b: "Try to offer them Savoy."

 lr_france.25.t: "France returned Corsica"
 lr_france.25.d: "The French agreed to partly add Corsica on the basis of the original agreement, so that Corsica, which once belonged to Genoa, and many compatriots will return together! After all, this is the hoemtown of the French Emperor, and it is still quite sincere to give it away."

 lr_france.25.b: "And what about Savoy?"   
 
 lr_france.26.t: "France has met our demands"
 lr_france.26.d: "We have no reason to refuse then..."
 lr_france.26.a: "Nice, no problem."
 lr_france.26.b: "I have changed my mind, we want the whole Gaul!"  
 
 lr_france.27.t: "They have refused."
 lr_france.27.d: "After our unprecedented concession, the arrogant "Roman" refused. It seems that it was a mistake from the beginning."
 lr_france.27.a: "We will parade at Rome."

 lr_france.28.t: "Unexpected Result"
 lr_france.28.d: "The meeting between Queen Marie and Jeanne drew a disaster! The famous murderer and arsonist "Black Virgin" arrived first and almost caused the Queen to be unpredictable, while Kingdom General Gille de Raiss seemed to be "another Joan of Arc" in the court, after the Black Saint's terrorist attack on the Palace of Versailles failed. He declared, "Let us raise the banner of salvation again under the guidance of the Black Virgin!" He led his department to openly rebel in Orleans, and a large number of soldiers who were extremely dissatisfied with the restoration of the Kingdom have already invested this rebel and his black Virgin. . However, from the past words and deeds of the "Black Virgin", she was just a demented lunatic who wanted to "burn France". The brutal collective execution and scorched earth policy in the rebellious area quickly woke up the blindly followed soldiers, and the Kingdom's military has After the assembly is complete and declare war on the rebels, how far can she and the mad marshal's path of destruction go?"
 lr_france.28.a: "Ma colère ne finit jamais!"
 lr_france.29.t: "Seek Support?"
 lr_france.29.d: "On this issue, the Black Virgin and Gille de Raiss rarely had a disagreement. She bluntly said that she did not like Gille de Raiss's friend, and also the Italian artist Francesca Prelati who has been secretly funding terrorist activities. "Gille! The Germans have tanks! Do you know ?! This is not the time when you killed a few children in the castle to summon demons!" And Gille de Raiss, known for his tyranny, treated her With rare patience, "I understand, but the virgin, no matter how the times change, the devil is still in everyone's heart, and the thing we have to do is to awaken the devil in people's hearts instead of simple killing.""
 lr_france.29.a: ""That's you, I just want to fight the Hundred Years' War, that's all."" 
 lr_france.29.b: ""Maybe the hundred years of war are over ...""
 lr_france.30.t: "The French insurgents sought support from us?!"
 lr_france.30.d: "It is very strange that the Black Virgin, who has recently caused a chaos in France, even asked us for reinforcements. According to her request, we should send "large size" troops to wear French uniforms and go directly to the French territory to fight, and the reward she promised is to join our camp after winning, then ..."
 lr_france.30.a: "We will send out "volunteers""
 lr_france.30.b: "Where did this psychopath come from?"
 lr_france.31.t: "German volunteers comes!"
 lr_france.31.d: "They agreed! The German army has disguised itself across the border to accept our command!"
 lr_france.31.a: "Let's revenge together!"
 lr_france.32.t: "Germany refused"
 lr_france.32.d: ""Uh, Jeanne, I really didn't lie to you, it's not that we have friends who share a common enemy.""
 lr_france.32.a: ""OK, what about your old friend then?""
 lr_france.33.t: ""Oh, isn't this Gille and the Virgin?""
 lr_france.33.d: ""Uh, Plerati, my friend! You really are ready," "Ah? After all, it seems that the Vrigin doesn't like me very much, so I'll wait for you to make a statement before showing up. So This is the gift I gave you, but I sold my all belongings for these arms. ""
 lr_france.33.a: ""Why didn't you sell yourself?""
 lr_france.34.t: "Black Virgin seeks help from us"
 lr_france.34.d: "The current French regime does implement their unique reverse nationalist theory, and naturally the legitimacy of their regime tends to zero indefinitely. And the police force we sent in the past was simply not enough. The large number of guerrilla warfare in the countryside even caused many police officers used to law enforcement in Germany to suffer "heavy casualties". For this reason, the Black Virgin proposed that we send a real big figure, so who should be sent? It seems that she appreciates the imperial security bureau chief's methods."
 lr_france.34.a: "Then send Heydrich." 
 lr_france.34.b: "Send his assistant"
 lr_france.35.t: "Here comes Heydrich"
 lr_france.35.d: "Reinhard Heidrich saw a ruin and a woman in black when she got off the plane. There is no doubt that it was the Black Virgin who came in to become a topic in the political circle of Berlin. In fact, it is still the ruins of the former Champs Elysées. It seems that she is playing a real game."
 lr_france.35.a: "The two shook hands enthusiastically." 
 lr_france.36.t: "Here comes Heydrich.....'s assistant"
 lr_france.36.d: "When Ernst Kaltenbrunner got off the plane, he saw a ruin and a woman in black. There is no doubt that it was the Black Virgin who was repeatedly mentioned by Mr. Heidrich recently, and this "airport "It's actually the ruins of the former Champs Elysées, which is really a bit confusing."
 lr_france.36.a: "The two shook hands." 

 lr_france.37.t: "Consolidate Domination"
 lr_france.37.d: "In fact, our rule is limited to the area around Orleans. Almost every "French" is resisting our "daily behavior." Naturally, this is not surprising. After all, we are here to destroy them. However, there is no resistance in the castle of Tiffauges. After the renovation, the castle has been used as the headquarters of the National Secret Police. According to legend, Gilles de Rais has always used this as a base to carry out torture of children... Naturally, there will be no such "fun" and meaningless things now, but no matter whether they are opponents or potential opponents, they will step into the castle one by one. Gilderas seems to have invested greater enthusiasm than the military command in this regard."
 lr_france.37.a: "Every castle will have this feature." 
 lr_france.38.t: "New Culture Movement"
 lr_france.38.d: "It's time to destroy consumer culture! It should be back to the time of the damn Valois dynasty when everyone is favor of fighting! Of course, we have no reason to drive the "French" to fight for us, but what about that? It 's time to prepare for the premiere of Joan of Arc, directed by Antonin Artaud and Francisca Plerati, we will use a gun or a burning flask to keep everything in the house The poor worms in the movie get out and watch the movie! Maybe this will subvert their worldview ... All we demand is this effect!"
 lr_france.38.a: ""Prepare that, Gilles""  
 lr_france.39.t: "Successful Premiere"
 lr_france.39.d: "The premiere on the ruins of Orleans City Hall is perfect! very successful! Although no one applauded ... this was not the case after the black saint who was hidden in the audience randomly burned to death, everyone began to applaud, for this almost unknown shit movie, "The plot that Jeanne d'Arc killed everyone in Hundred Years War is just bullshit..."One person finally couldn't help but stop applauding, and then he was taken away by the secret police and tied to the torture rack."
 lr_france.39.a: ""It was so good! Why are there complaints?!""   
 lr_france.40.t: "In the Shadow"
 lr_france.40.d: ""Never let this lunatic continue to run rampant!" "Must kill her!" "And the Italian guy!!! It was the bastard who led the so-called renovation of Notre Dame!" A few in the basement of a Parisian cafe The French indignantly poured out their hatred of the current powers. For this reason, they let go of everything in the past. Both the socialists towards Moscow and the royalist party that led the retro movement were united, but the meeting was evolving into outrage."
 lr_france.40.a: ""Kill that Lunatic!""  
 lr_france.40.b: ""No more words, action tommorrow!""  
 lr_france.41.t: "Successful Raid"
 lr_france.41.d: "There have been several "secret rallies" that have been destroyed by Francisca-led remediation operations recently, erm ... Although most of them are just civilians venting their dissatisfaction, this is still unforgivable! The new order of the Black Virgin is perfect and cannot be questioned by anyone, and now these people will all be put on fire and burned to death."
 lr_france.41.a: ""I started to change my mind towards that bitch!!""  
 lr_france.42.t: "Action Preparation"
 lr_france.42.d: "Finally, after not knowing how many quarrels, the participants finally decided to rush into Orleans! Kill the crazy woman! But what about weapons? The bloodthirsty lunatics under the mad women showed their unique high efficiency, and almost all the arms in France were taken away."
 lr_france.42.a: ""I used to be an arms dealer!""   
 lr_france.43.t: "Before the Action"
 lr_france.43.d: ""I was thinking in the past, when she was just a rural bandit, thinking about why she destroyed France so persistently, or who is she?" "Is this important?" The arms dealer who is distributing weapons as if he had become the leader of this squad, he seemed uninterested in the speech of the young man. "Of course it is important, sir, do you know where she came from?""
 lr_france.43.a: ""It's true that I really don't know, who of you know?""
 lr_france.44.t: "Sudden big discussion"
 lr_france.44.d: "What exactly is the Black Virgin? No one seemed to be able to answer this question. She was like a whirlwind sweeping around the area of Orleans, gathering a group of potential death row criminals to kill and set fire. There are many slogans, and the content is nothing more than "burning France", so she should be a guy with a deep hatred against France. Is she Jeanne's reincarnation? But isn't the real Jeanne there? So, some kind of "Homunculus" did the Germans make to destroy us?"
 lr_france.44.a: ""Fuck it! Don't think about killing her tomorrow!"" 
 lr_france.45.t: "The assassination plot was foiled"
 lr_france.45.d: "There have been several "secret rallies" that have been destroyed by Francesca-led remediation operations. Although most of them are just civilians who are venting their dissatisfaction, there are special ones! The secret police found armed people gathered during a routine inspection of a coffee shop in Paris. After the fierce exchange of fire, we paid a lot of casualties to wipe them out, but unfortunately these people did not have to go to the fire."
 lr_france.45.a: ""I started to change my mind towards that bitch!!""  
 lr_france.46.t: "Proclaim our new order"
 lr_france.46.d: "Almost all organized resistance movements have been destroyed under our series of iron fist policies. Marshal Gilles de Rais and Francesca even complained that the castles in the entire territory are not enough. Now that the French either start to support us or have despaired about reality and can only support us, then it is time to start a real career! First of all, we will stand in the world with a new name!"
 lr_france.46.a: "Royal director Artaud suggested keeping the name of France and calling it the pioneer."  
 lr_france.46.b: "The Black Virgin insisted on erasing France, in the name of the dragon."  
 lr_france.47.t: "Question"
 lr_france.47.d: ""By the way, Jill, did you really check the origin of the Black Virgin?" Francisca rarely asked questions about things, and this question is definitely going to come. Sure enough, the mad marshal stopped the gratuitous dance, closed the book and thoughtfully stayed for a long time. "I really don't know where she came from. When I met her she was like this now, in the countryside of Orleans ... I honestly never thought about where she came from? Anyway you and I The ideal is gradually being realized ... or ... Plerati, why don't you ask why we are in this era? ""
 lr_france.47.a: ""Ahaha! I'm over worried."" 
 lr_france.48.t: "Find Collaborator"
 lr_france.48.d: "At the suggestion of the German consultant, Lord Black Virgin took the means of enveloping the French, and soon some activists stood out among the collaborators. Far-rightist Jacques Doriot, an ex-communist and Pierre Raval, a politician known for flattering Germany before the Kingdom is retored, was their representative. The two men were appointed Ministers of the Interior and Prime Minister after sworn allegiance to the Black Virgin and the highest German leader far from Berlin."
 lr_france.48.a: ""Work hard, or die.""
 lr_france.49.t: "Back to time before the restoration?"
 lr_france.49.d: "Dorio and Raval quickly summoned a large number of politicians from the time of the original French Republic. Their composition is still quite messy. There are right-wingers and left-wingers in the past. This is not important to us. Anyway, It is enough for them to be willing to "rebuild the country" under the eyes of the Black Virgin and the Germans."
 lr_france.49.a: ""They are professional in this respect.""
 lr_france.50.t: "Drafting a new constitution?"
 lr_france.50.d: "Gradually, we are now more and more like a "France", it seems that this is a little against the original intention of the Black Lady, France has not been destroyed ... how could it be? Wouldn't it be more fun to let them under German rule than to destroy them? So now Laval presents a document, he hopes to establish a dictatorship that upholds the three principles of "working family, motherland", then the name of the country will be changed to a relatively formal "France", this maybe..."
 lr_france.50.a: ""It doesn't matter, you could remain a name.""
 lr_france.50.b: ""France? Do you dare to mention it?"" 
 lr_france.51.t: "A self-defeat..."
 lr_france.51.d: "The first motorized division of the "French Thuleschutztruppe" led by Jacques Doriot has been completed. Today this force will be inspected by the Cabinet in Orleans, only when Prime Minister Laval is speaking to the soldiers on behalf of the Cabinet. In an accident, a soldier raised the Mauser rifle in his hand and turned the trigger against him. Until now, Laval, who was sent to Germany for first aid, was out of danger, and the perpetrators were executed by the Black Lady on the spot. Afterwards, Doriot was forced to conduct a political review of all soldiers and stopped all training programs."
 lr_france.51.a: ""It's a real waste.""
 lr_france.52.t: "German worker attacked"
 lr_france.52.d: "Recently, there have been many vicious incidents around the German workers 'camps in my country. Many workers in the camps were attacked in urban areas and in the wild after get off work. There were dozens of serious incidents that caused deaths. Maybe we should continue to introduce security forces from Germany, otherwise we cannot maintain the stability of the entire French land with our troops loyal to us, and cooperation with Germany is impossible to talk about then."
 lr_france.52.a: ""Request some polices from them?""  
 lr_france.53.t: "Investigation report sent to Himmler"
 lr_france.53.d: "... It seems that as you thought, the brainwashing of the two Joan of Arc clones in the early years can be said to be a complete failure, and the defective product that never grew up lost all its memories. This one who works with us is also based on his inner thoughts rather than psychological hints. In short, it is not a bad thing to continue such cooperation. Although her country is not completely controlled by us, there is no reason to oppose us. I personally recommend that you do not instruct Old Man Einzberen to clone foreign dignitaries. Regarding the current situation as if it could be reproduced at will. Oh, and be careful not to let Miss Alice touch the core of the experiment, and remember to close the cultivation tank. ———— Your loyal Rhinehard Heidrich"
 lr_france.53.a: ""Let this secret die forever""  
 lr_france.54.t: "Loyal French Thuleschutztruppe"
 lr_france.54.d: "After the last vicious incident, Dorio once again formed the second armoured grenadier division of the "French Thuleschutztruppe". This time, after carefully selecting the political qualities of the soldiers, no one finally shot at the rostrum. Then, the soldiers held their heads up and their morale was uplifted, ready to fight side by side with the German allies under the command of the Black Virgin."
 lr_france.54.a: ""It finally looks a bit correct."" 
 lr_france.55.t: "Liberate Colonies"
 lr_france.55.d: "We had no interest in the colonies, and the colonial government did not take a stand in the Civil War. It's time to direct rule from Orleans."
 lr_france.55.a: ""Demand them to obey""  

 lr_france.56.t: "Demands from Orlean"
 lr_france.56.d: "Orleans ordered us to dissolve government institutions and obey them completely, which may not be a good idea. The colonies are now packed with politicians and generals of the former kingdom, who are not going to do so."
 lr_france.56.a: ""Seek help from King of Britain""   
 lr_france.56.b: ""We have no other choices"" 
 lr_france.56.c: "I refuse!"

 lr_france.57.t: "Call from French colonies"
 lr_france.57.d: "France, which was in power, seemed to be trying to consolidate its rule over the colonies recently, while the ousted royal government had shown us a willingness to form an "British-French United Kingdom" that would now leave the colonies of West Africa and the Indo-Chinese peninsula to us, and that in the future we would be able to begin the domination across the Straits if we defeated the demons of Orleans."
 lr_france.57.a: "At least we are in agreement against lunatics."   
 lr_france.57.b: "We are not going to provoke..."   

 lr_france.58.t: "They refused"
 lr_france.58.d: "We have no choices"
 lr_france.58.a: "This is our destiny"   
 lr_france.59.t: "Arrest Prelati"
 lr_france.59.d: "We cannot tolerate this madwoman continuing to make deceptive speeches on our land! For national security and the safety of all mankind, this lunatic must stay in prison!"
 lr_france.59.a: "Successful arrest"   
 lr_france.60.t: "Prelati committed suicide"
 lr_france.60.d: "Perhaps some human rights people will be slightly dissatisfied. Prelati, who was arrested and imprisoned a week ago, died suddenly. Forensic investigation revealed that she left a lot of strange symbols in the cell and pierced the carotid artery with a sharpened spoon. At present, this matter has been spread."
 lr_france.60.a: "It's okay if this guy is dead."  

 lr_france.61.t: "Be careful about French lunatic"
 lr_france.61.d: "Crazy French are deploying troops on our borders, we must beware of them!"
 lr_france.61.a: "Understood."   

 lr_france.62.t: "Statutory Arson Day"
 lr_france.62.d: ""Burn! Burn! Burn!! Burn it for me at this time of the year!" After the order was issued, this day of the year was an "arson day". Every resident under our rule had to light his own house. Must be so. So after encountering some resistance, the Black Virgin personally put the first fire on Notre Dame de Paris. The blue beard and Plerati's men followed up, and soon the entire France was shrouded in flames."
 lr_france.62.a: "Burn and change a name"  
 lr_france.63.t: "Germans have run!"
 lr_france.63.d: ""Jeanne d'Arc, I don't know why you are doing this. The Germans have taken control of all aspects of us. You are all done with this.""
 lr_france.63.a: ""So what?""

Duke Richelieu, the minister of the navy, stepped into the door of the design bureau conference room in black leather boots, hurriedly took off his coat and high military cap, and hung it on the coat hanger at the door. Several senior Admiralty officials and design bureau engineers in the room sat around the oval table, waiting for the meeting to begin. "20 years after the end of World War I, the French navy has never been like this -" Richelieu paused, slightly closing his eyes and glancing at the crowd. "awkward." "as you already know, Italy is building a new battleship, Venetto, equipped with nine 15-inch main guns, while Bismarck, which the Germans are preparing, is said to be equipped with 15-inch guns. What about us? Not long ago, the Dunkerque had just been launched, the No. 2 turret of the Strasbourg had not been installed, and main guns of these two ships were only 330mm. If it goes on like this, not to mention being on an equal footing with the British, even the Mediterranean will lose control. That's what I came back from Indochina last month to solve. I've met with Queen Mary, who supports the navy's expansion plan, and the Ministry of Finance has approved funding under the project code PN-196. So your task today is to find a feasible new capital ship programme to regain French hegemony in the Mediterranean. ""

 fn.2.d: ""The first thing to be sure is the hull, whether it is a battleship or a battlecruiser. What do you think? “ “Battleships are the main force in future naval battles, and now it is obvious that our capital ships must be able to effectively protect against attacks by 15-inch guns. If this standard is not met, our front lines will become fragile in a decisive battle. An Admiralty official said slowly, "first of all, we must figure out what our strategic purpose is."Another naval officer stood up and went to the huge map of Europe hanging on the wall. "We are not going to fight a decisive battle at sea with the large-scale British fleet, our main purpose is to control the Mediterranean and attack the maritime lines of Italy. Only the capital ships with high speed can achieve this goal. In addition, our ships have to face the threat of torpedoes and aircraft, which also reflects the necessity of high speed. And now that our country's finances are tight, the relatively cheap battlecruisers are the most suitable choice. Current technology can completely achieve high-speed battleships, as long as the layout is reasonable." "Have you forgotten the lesson of the Battle of Jutland? " Another general retorted. The discussion became more and more heated, and in the end, the consensus was that--"
 fn.2.a: "Battleship"

 fn.3.t: "Project PN-196——Main Battery"
 fn.3.d: ""Considering the current situation, we should also choose the caliber of the 15-inch main gun. The most critical problem is that there are now two layout schemes--one is to continue to use the Dunkerque-class two front quadruple batteries, and the other is to return to the traditional three triple batteries. ""The advantage of the quadruple main gun is that the firepower is further concentrated, the main armor belt is effectively shortened, and the weight of the ship is greatly reduced, so more remaining design weight can be used for the power part and the air defense part. The defect is that the technology of our quadruple turret is not very mature, and its reliability will be affected to a certain extent. at the same time, the distance between the guns is too close, and the wakes interfere with each other when the projectile comes out of the chamber, resulting in trajectory deviation and increasing the walking surface. And because there are only two turrets, if one is destroyed in battle, the combat effectiveness of the whole ship will be greatly reduced. To solve this problem, armored bulkheads need to be set up in the quadruple main turret to divide the turret into the left and right parts. The Dunkerque design verified that this scheme is effective." An engineer explained the technical details in detail."

 fn.4.d: ""with regard to the choice of projectiles, it is best to continue our own tradition, using high-speed heavy projectiles to increase the power and range of the main gun by increasing the amount of charge." "Mr. Minister, I have an idea that we can add a gas chamber inside the projectile and fill it with poison gas so that even if it does not break through the armor of the enemy ship, it can cause damage to the personnel in it." "Hmm? That's an interesting idea. ""

The 152mm secondary artillery is enough to effectively attack the enemy lightship, and the rear product font layout can make up for the emptiness of the firepower behind the ship to a certain extent. The 152mm gun used on our cruiser has proved to be so successful that it can be modified to a new battleship. " "these guns should be arranged in separate turrets, powered by hydraulically driven motors and RPC. And the guns should be able to be loaded at any angle and equipped with three projectile lifting systems, one for surface projectiles, one for anti-aircraft projectiles, and one for cartridges so that weapons can be quickly switched between different types of projectiles. The artillery is required to achieve a 90-degree elevation to achieve the dual purpose. ""

 fn.6.t: "Project PN-196——Anti-Air"
 fn.6.d: "The semi-automatic 37mm anti-aircraft gun (37mm/50 CAIL Model 1933) currently equipped by the navy has lagged, so it is difficult to meet the needs of modern air defense. We need a new fully automatic 37mm antiaircraft gun, which is being designed by the Luenavale Artillery Research Institute, each with a lift for six-round magazines and remote control with a 2m rangefinder for use with an electric servo motor for the RPC."

 fn.7.t: "Project PN-196——Fire Control, Radar and Aircraft Ejection Devices"

The most advanced 13.5-meter large rangefinder should be equipped in the main gun firing command tower, and the 8-meter rangefinder should also be installed in the main gun firing backup command tower. after the main command tower is damaged, the standby command tower can take over its duties. Each main turret needs to be equipped with a 14-meter rangefinder and a secondary turret with an 8-meter rangefinder. Each main/secondary turret must be equipped with an independent observation system to ensure that the commander can still shoot independently after being damaged. All fire control rangefinders, including those inside the turret, need to be combined. " "the British took the lead in using radar devices on warships, and we must not lag. Since the current domestic radar technology is not accurate enough to provide firing parameters for fire control, the new capital ship should at least install centimeter wave sea search radar and air search radar to ensure that close large surface ship targets and low altitude targets within 30 miles can be detected. " "shipborne aircraft play a vital role in spying on the enemy and correcting the impact point of the projectile, and the new capital ship should be designed to carry two to three Loire-Newport 130 seaplanes and two catapults.""

Is it a holiday today? No, but it may be just as significant, because today, France's newest battleship, the Richelieu, is about to unfold her legend. To celebrate the launching of the world's most advanced warship, many celebrities flocked to the celebration, while it was the royal motorcade driving slowly in the middle of the road. Jeanne d'Arc stood in the back seat of the car, constantly waving to the crowd, her long flowing blond hair and warm smile on her delicate face made her particularly holy. Next to the saint, it was the dignified and elegant queen, Marie Antoinette, whose slender and graceful body was wrapped in a gorgeous white bare-shouldered dress, revealing her back skin as delicate and smooth as velvet silk, and under her smart and leaping eyebrows, the beautiful blue eyes were as sweet and cheerful as the Paris Champs Elysees at night. At this time, the apple of the palm, as a symbol of France, talked excitedly with the crowd, and her lovely and innocent face glowed as warm as the sun. Not far from the dock, the majestic Richelieu was solemnly moored, eight huge main guns were lifted into the sky, and countless colorful flags fluttered on the mainmast, like an epic hero."

Waves hit, rolling up the white spray and caressing the side of the ship. Standing behind the waist-high railing, the saint first made the opening speech of the ceremony, followed by Queen Marie Antoinette's motivational speech. As the ceremony went on, the crowd burst into cheers and applause. The Minister of the Navy, Duke Richelieu, Defense Minister Bradamante, and Prime Minister Leo B. Harvey stood not far behind them, bowing their heads and whispering about something. Time passed quickly, the ceremony drew to a close, and with the long sound of sirens and the roar of a gun salute, the battleship Richelieu gradually sailed out of the harbor."

After the explosion, the deck of the battleship Richelieu burst into flames, and two guns were completely damaged. after timely fire fighting and emergency repair, the main body of the ship was not seriously injured. According to unknown sources, the cause of the accident seems to be related to the substandard quality of the projectiles used. The military has not issued any clarification on the accident. Queen Marie issued an obituary in the name of the royal family, expressing her deep condolences for the martyrs and saying that she would investigate the cause of the accident. According to the news of the second edition, the Paris Stock Exchange showed another large-scale rise today, with a number of securities companies issuing statements."

 fn.13.t: "Project PN-196 The 2nd Battleship"
 fn.13.d: "With the formal start of the development of the weapons of the No. 1 warship of the PN-196 program, more and more problems are gradually exposed. The most serious problem is that the elevation angle of the 152mm  secondary gun used in the No. 1 warship can not reach 90 degrees of the predetermined target, and after the efforts of a large number of engineers, it can only reach 75 degrees at most. On the other hand, the elastic loading system matched with it is not mature, and the ROF is low, but it can not be maintained. At the same time, the rotation and pitching speed of the turret is not up to standard, so it is impossible to track fast-moving air targets. These problems meant that the gun could not complete the scheduled air defense mission, causing the six new 37mm automatic anti-aircraft guns of the No. 1 ship to become the only medium-range air defense weapons. Weak air defense capability has become the deadliest weakness of the new first-class capital ship. In order to make up for these defects, for the No. 2 warship that is about to start, we must find a way to modify the original design as soon as possible. Duke Richelieu has summoned Admiralty officials and Design Bureau engineers to discuss improvements to the No. 2 ship. Time is running out, it is difficult for us to make major changes to the overall layout, we can only change some local designs, starting with secondary guns and anti-aircraft guns."

The gun uses barrel self-tightening technology, semi-automatic loading, elastic impact loading to achieve arbitrary angle loading. The twin guns share a set of pitching devices with a pitch angle of-10 to 80 degrees and fire integrated ammunition. High explosive projectiles equipped with timing fuzes and semi-armor-piercing projectiles against light targets at close range can be used with a firing speed of 10 rounds per minute.

According to the data provided by the Luenavale Artillery Research Institute, the cyclic firing rate of a single gun can reach 165172 rounds per minute. To protect the complex ammunition supply structure, they designed a dual gun seat with an open circular arc cover and introduced an RPC system to control the azimuth, which uses electricity to drive the gun seat rotation, which is the first time in the world, although the gun pitch still has to be manually controlled. Unfortunately, the development of the gun has not yet been completed, only 2 sets of samples have been produced in the workshop, and there are still many problems. According to the current progress, it is estimated that the No. 1 ship will not be equipped with this kind of anti-aircraft gun. instead, we will probably have to install the old semi-automatic 37mm/50 CAIL Model 1933 anti-aircraft gun on the No. 1 ship.

Index: except for the improvement part, the other indexes are basically the same as those of the No. 1 warship. The boiler test shows that the transmission system of No. 1 and No. 2 warships is efficient and reliable, but the deficiency is that when the engine is running at medium and low power, the energy conversion rate of the engine is relatively low. therefore, the fuel consumption of economic speed is larger and the endurance is poor.

Since the Navy wanted to start the construction of the No. 3 ship as soon as the No. 1 ship was launched, the Duke finally chose the A2 case, which was questioned, as the basis for the design of the No. 3 ship. The improved B3 TER project was selected as the basis for the design of the No. 4 warship with relatively plenty of time. The final design of the No. 3 warship continues the layout of the A2 case, which is similar to that of the No. 1 warship as a whole, and mainly adjusts the layout of secondary guns. The improvements are as follows: keep the secondary gun, cancel one secondary turret at the stern and change it to two knapsack layouts. This ingenious design provides additional control space for the new anti-aircraft gun and limits the weight gain to only about 50 tons. After the removal of the four twin 100mm turrets on both sides of the tower, the remaining two 100mm turrets are lightened to ensure that the weight of the superstructure does not exceed the standard, and after it is moved to the No. 2 main turret, the number of 37mm anti-aircraft guns remains unchanged, but the position is adjusted accordingly. However, this design relatively limits the firing range of the No. 2 main turret, which will be reduced from 286 degrees to 278 degrees when the two anti-aircraft guns are fired. On the other hand, all new 100mm guns are equipped with 30mm armour to protect against shrapnel and muzzle storms. In addition, minor adjustments are made to the front armor of each secondary gun to offset the increase in the center of gravity brought about by the knapsack layout."
 fn.10.a: "I, navy, Rich！"

 fn.11.t: "The No. 4 ship"
 fn.11.d: "The B3 ter programme is an almost brand-new design and has been widely praised by the Admiralty. Its innovation lies in the average placement of the two main turrets at the front and rear of the ship, making up for the firepower behind the ship. The front 2 and rear 1 of the secondary gun is arranged on the central axis, which can also provide the firepower of 9 doors on one side. Both 100mm anti-aircraft guns and 37mm anti-aircraft guns have increased from 6 to 8. All anti-aircraft guns are installed on the side of the open firing boundary, which is far away from each other, and each group is controlled by a controller, so that there is less interference with each other, and the efficiency of air defense is significantly improved. The front two knapsack layout 152mm secondary guns can also provide strong support for the forward direction of the greater threat of torpedo strikes. The armored area of the whole ship is only less than 4 meters longer than the No. 1 ship, and thanks to a reasonable layout, the weight has been reduced by 360 tons. The final design scheme of the No. 4 warship follows the basic layout of the B3 ter case, but the difference lies in that the catapult is moved back to the stern, the layout of the new battleship of the US military is adopted, and the hangar is placed longitudinally inside the ship, which solves the problem that the firing of the original main gun affects the anti-aircraft gun. The protection of the secondary gun is further strengthened compared with the No. 3 ships and the front, side, top, and gun seat armor have been improved to a certain extent. As the secondary turret is reduced by 1 compared with the No. 3 warship, the exposed chimney above the main deck is also allowed to enhance protection from 20mm to 30mm. As a result of the increase in air defense weapons, the number of small boats of the No. 4 ship has been reduced from 17 to 12 compared with that of the No. 3 ship."

The new warship selects the 3x4 joint main gun design in plan 3, using the 'front 2 and rear 1' layout, which greatly increases the firepower delivery compared with the 'Richelieu' class. On the other hand, the firing speed of 12 guns is faster than that of 8 guns.

Thanks to the extension of the hull, the side is equipped with the newly developed 100mm/55 Model 1940  dual-purpose gun, which can be regarded as a growth version of model 1933. The barrel uses a self-tightening integral type, with a semi-automatic sliding wedge locking machine, the firing speed, range, and power have been improved, and the number has increased from 8 to 12, divided into front and rear groups arranged on both sides of the ship. The number of 37mm anti-aircraft guns has also increased to 12, of which four are arranged between the front and rear groups of 100mm anti-aircraft guns, and the other eight are arranged on both sides of the 152mm secondary guns between the No. 2 (3) main turret and the front (rear) tower. The fire control of the 100mm  dual-purpose gun is assisted by four command and rangefinders along the side of the superstructure, while the fire control of the 37mm anti-aircraft gun is controlled by a controller for every two sets. Similar to the layout of 'Gascogne', this design effectively reduces the interference between anti-aircraft guns and improves the efficiency of air defense, and a large number of anti-aircraft guns form a dense firepower network, making the air defense capability of the new ship more powerful than ever before.

The first round of airstrikes flew over the Joffre, and under the ship's flexible evasion, the German attack did not work, but a destroyer escorted was hit by a torpedo and sank. The Naval Command received a request for help from the captain of the 'Joffre' and found that the only battleship that could arrive in the nearby sea area in a short time was the battleship Alsace, which happened to pass by this area while returning to Hong Kong to refuel after the mission.

The rotation of the turret and the pitching of the barrel are driven by electricity and hydraulic pressure, and the firing is directly controlled by the RPC system controlled by the central fire control system. The two guns on both sides of the turret have independent ammunition depots and projectile lifting mechanisms, which can be pitched independently, and there are also two 90mm artillery firing flares on both sides of each turret to enhance the night combat capability. The hooded armor-piercing projectile weighs 1320 kilograms and is 200cm long, which is longer than the overweight projectile used by American battleships. The super-long projectile gives it excellent aerodynamic shape, making the trajectory farther and more stable. The SD23' propellant, which weighs up to 364kg per shot, enables the projectile to reach an initial velocity of 810m / s, giving it the world's strongest vertical armor erosion and the longest range. In actual tests, the gun eroded 582mm of vertical armor at 20000 (30000) meters. However, the high charge also shortens the life of the gun barrel, about 190 rounds. In order to alleviate the influence of the muzzle storm of the 4-equipped main gun on walking, the gun is equipped with a 0.06-second delay firing device, which allows the first and third guns to fire first, and a gyro stabilizer is installed at the same time, which significantly reduces the gun walk. the improved projectile system also enables the firing speed to reach 2.2 rounds per minute, which is the same as that of the American-made 16-inch naval gun."

On the other hand, due to the increase in the weight and volume of 127mm  dual-purpose guns, the new ship is expected to be equipped with 16 guns of this type, with eight double assemblies divided into front and rear four groups arranged on both sides of the ship's hull, one for each group under the command of one fire control radar."

The new anti-aircraft gun is designed to be 57mm Compact 60 and is installed in a twin-mounted ACAD with a total turret weight of 18 tons. The cannon uses 2.96kg (6.5lb) heavy projectiles with an initial velocity of 850m / s, a firing speed of 120m / min, a maximum range of 14500 m and a maximum range of 5500 m at a muzzle elevation of 90 degrees. The new ship is planned to be equipped with 24 anti-aircraft guns of this type, of which 8 double-assembled ACAD are arranged on both sides of the front and rear secondary guns, and 4 of them are arranged on the inside of the front and rear 127mm  dual-purpose guns.

Besides, two 8-meter-long OPL stereo double-diameter rangefinders were installed next to the fire control system of the front tower and on the rear tower as a backup for the main rangefinder, and three 8-meter OPL stereo double-diameter rangefinders were installed on three 152mm secondary guns for use. To enhance the accuracy of radar fire control, the new ship plans to install two ACAE radars to guide long-range air defense artillery and an ABM fire control radar to guide the main gun on the firing system of the front tower. The installation of DRBV- 10 water surface detection radar above the command tower, DRBV- 30 navigation radar at the top of the mainmast, and DRBV- 20 air surveillance radar at the top of the rear main mast proved to be very effective within a range of 25000 meters."

The French transport fleet has been attacked many times by the German Scharnhorst class battlecruiser, and its equipped 283mm artillery and speed as high as 32 knots frequently make our convoy cruiser suffer serious losses, and the 152mm and 203mm guns of light and heavy cruisers can hardly cause effective damage to it. After several battles, Admiral Jean de Laborde, commander of the Northern Joint Fleet, had to order the dispatch of only a few major ships in the North Sea, such as the battlecruiser Dunkerque, to escort the important fleet, and it must be admitted that this is a huge waste of the main force of the French Northern Fleet. Admiral Laborde pointed out that if the German heavy cruiser team uses night warfare to attack our aircraft carrier formation at high speed, it will be very difficult for our escort ships to ensure the safety of aircraft carriers. Because of this situation, the Minister of the Navy, Duke Richelieu, once again put forward the idea of large cruiser. This new type of warship has both the powerful firepower of a battleship and the high speed of a heavy cruiser, which is enough to defeat the Scharnhorst class battlecruiser. At the same time, the heavy cruiser formation of the other side can be hunted and killed, and even if it encounters the battleship, it can quickly get out of the battlefield at high speed. The Navy has held several meetings to this end and worked out the design plan for the new type of warship."

The gun has a caliber of 305mm (12 inches) and is a reduced version of the new 380mm/50 main gun equipped by the 'Alsace' class battleship. the structure of the gun body and the double diameter of the barrel is the same. The barrel tightening gun body is composed of an inner bore tube, an equal length reinforcement layer, and a rear three-layer quilt barrel, and there are two locking rings and a screw latch with a hydraulic switch at the end of the gun. The armor-piercing projectile fired by the gun weighs 508kg and has an initial speed of 890m/s. It can pierce 354mm vertical armor at a distance of 20km. The new ship plans to install three-four combined turrets, each weighing 1120 tons, with a maximum elevation of 35 degrees, and a maximum range of 41000 meters at 35 degrees, the same as the Alsace class scheme. the improved loading system can achieve an average firing rate of 3 rounds per minute and a barrel life of 300 rounds. According to the updated main gun design standard of the French Navy, all-new turrets are equipped with 0.06 second delayed firing devices and gyro stabilizers, and the firing is directly controlled by the RPC system and the central fire control system. Compared with the Dunkerque class, the ship's 12 305mm guns greatly increase the firing speed and firepower delivery, which shows the difference in positioning between her and the Dunkerque class, the former is completely designed for the Scharnhorst class and hunting cruisers."

The specific design is as follows: 15-degree tilted 240mm main armor belt, the lower end is gradually thinned to 140mm, and a layer of 14mm anti-collapse lining is added on the inside. Horizontal protection consists of three layers, the first layer is 36mm deck armor, the second layer is 100mm main horizontal armor, and the third layer is 15mm fragment partition. The main turret is protected by front 330mm, side 180mm to 200mm, top 150mm, rear-end 200mm, seat 330mm. To reduce weight, the secondary turret protection is lightweight and the front is reduced from the Richelieu class 130mm to the 116mm. The front and top of the command tower armor are 300mm and 130mm respectively. Due to the limited width and weight of the ship, the underwater protection adopts the triple bottom protection of the French battleship in the same period, but the torpedo protection compartment is reduced to 1, and the protection capability is between the battlecruiser and the heavy cruiser."

The 152mm gun is assembled with four seats and three seats, of which one is in the front, which is carried behind the No. 2 main turret and three in the rear and is arranged in the shape of goods. The advantage of this layout is to maintain the firepower of 9 secondary guns on one side, shorten the length of the armored box as much as possible, and save space for the arrangement of anti-aircraft guns. The 100mm  dual-purpose gun is assembled with 8 seats and 2, and the front and rear groups are arranged on both sides of the ship hull, with the 100mm gunfire controller in the middle.

The military had expected to build a regular aircraft carrier with a standard displacement of 25000 tons in the late 1930s, drawing on the operational experience of the Béarn. However, because France's imaginary enemy, Germany, was restricted by the Versailles Peace Treaty, bound by the Washington Naval Treaty, and France's financial difficulties, the French Navy gave up building aircraft carriers. Until 1936, the French navy still had only one aircraft carrier, and the ship also found many defects in its operation for many years, and the vigorous development of aircraft carriers by the United States and Japan also made the French navy gradually realize the important position of carriers in future naval warfare. As Germany became more and more disobedient to the Versailles treaty, the French navy began to reconsider the ship-building plan of the new aircraft carrier, and they put forward two options: one is to convert the original Ducken-class cruiser into a light carrier; the other is to build two 18000-ton neutral aircraft carriers. However, when the French authorities learned not long ago that the German navy had begun to build a Zeppelin class aircraft carrier, they immediately abandoned their previous idea and decided to start building a truly large aircraft carrier to counter Germany's actions and regain maritime superiority, codenamed 'PA-16''."

The superstructure of the ship adopts an integrated island design, and the inclined chimney, mast, and bridge are integrated and placed on the starboard side of the hull, which can effectively reduce the problems such as smoke and turbulence on the rear deck. this new design has been fully verified in the Dunkerque class battleship. In order to adapt to the complex sea conditions of the Atlantic Ocean, the ship creatively uses a closed bow, which has also become a major feature of the shape. The ship has a total length of 232.5 meters and a width of 33.1m, of which the flight deck is a single one with a length of 229.7 meters, with a double-deck hangar, which can accommodate up to 84 carrier-based aircraft, and is equipped with three elevators at the front, middle and rear of the deck to improve take-off efficiency. there are two catapults on the bow flight deck and a stop cable is arranged at the front and rear of the deck. In terms of armor, the ship is positioned to defend against light cruisers, air-dropped bombs and air-dropped torpedoes. The specific design is: waterline armor 63.5mm to 105mm, can resist 152mm artillery, deck armor 40 mm, and add a layer of 70mm armor above the hangar to prevent the bomb from penetrating into the key hangar and the lower armory, underwater protection is triple bottom protection, and there are several torpedo protection compartments and watertight compartments, with the main armored belt to protect torpedo attacks.

The Joffre was launched under the auspices of Admiral Jean de LaPolde, a pioneer of French naval aviation and a former captain of France's first aircraft carrier, the Beyain. After several months of trial voyage, the 'Joffre' was incorporated into the second Special mixed formation of the French Northern Joint Fleet and deployed at the naval base of Calais. During this period, she participated in several important maritime military exercises, accumulating valuable experience for the tactical command and operation of the French naval air force, and it was precisely in these exercises that the French naval air force established the established standard of the aviation brigade, which consists of 30 fighters, 36 dive bombers (divided into two squadrons) and 18 torpedo bombers.

While reviewing the shipbuilding plan, Duke Richelieu, the minister of the navy, found that the number of French naval aircraft carriers was too small and that the new fleet aircraft carriers might not be in service for a long time. So she asked for the rapid expansion of a number of light aircraft carriers based on the hull of cruisers. As a result, the French navy accelerated the design of new heavy aircraft carriers on the one hand and began to study light aircraft carriers the size of cruisers on the other. Although designers have proposed that this modified aircraft carrier will have many safety and seaworthiness restrictions, such as re-laying the hangar deck above the original deck of the cruiser will raise the ship's center of gravity and cause lack of stability, the weak hangar armor will cause hidden dangers to the hangar and hull strength, and the narrow flight deck will make it more difficult for carrier-based aircraft to take off and land, but the dangerous situation does not allow any hesitation. Soon Queen Mary ordered approval to convert six of the Bayard class light cruisers being developed and planned for construction into light aircraft carriers.

Hangars, flight decks and islands mean a significant increase in the weight of the upper hull, resulting in a significant increase in the center of gravity. In order to solve this problem, the Navy decided to set up torpedo protection protrusions on both sides of the slender hull of the original cruiser, which can not only increase the buoyancy and stability of the ship, but also set up heavy oil tanks inside it to increase the endurance of the warship. at the same time, it can also enhance the ability to resist torpedo attacks. The modified light aircraft carrier is equipped with two lifts, which are arranged before and after the hangar, and equipped with a hydraulic catapult. In terms of armor protection, the 130mm waterline armor of the original cruiser can provide effective protection against 152mm guns, but in order to reduce the weight of the upper part of the ship, the hangar armor is thin, only 50mm, and the flight deck is made of wood with a layer of very light armor attached to it. The level of underwater protection is to add a torpedo protection bag on the basis of the original cruiser, which can defend against the attack of air-dropped torpedo to a certain extent.

Although there is still a weak possibility of taking off and landing aircraft after the lift is destroyed, the combat capability of the aircraft carrier will also be greatly reduced. In order to deal with the attacks of a large number of land-based aircraft from Germany and Italy and improve the viability of aircraft carriers, the French navy decided to design a new class of heavily armored aircraft carriers with reference to the characteristics of British 'brilliant' class aircraft carriers. On the other hand, the prowess of aircraft carriers in the Atlantic Ocean has also made the Navy determined to speed up the construction of aircraft carriers. The combination of the two factors led to a new plan for the expansion of a large aircraft carrier. Thanks to the Queen's strong support, and following a fierce quarrel in the Supreme Council, the Navy finally won funding for four new aircraft carriers. In order to commemorate the great contribution made by Marshal Ferdinand Foch in World War I, Jeanne suggested that the first ship be named "Foch"."

 fn.31.t: "Hull"
 fn.31.d: "The Foch class follows the basic characteristics of the Joffre class, such as closed bow, integral island, all-pass flight deck, double hangar, etc., but the deck protection is greatly enhanced. The flight deck is directly involved in the hull composition, which is covered with 76mmCNC armor and reinforced with 114mm armor above the key ammunition depots, which enables the Fuxu class to withstand 1000-pound aerial bomb attacks. Of course, the heavy armor also brings a disadvantage, that is, the center of gravity is on the high side, and the stability of the hull has decreased, so the freeboard height of the ship is lower than that of Joffre class, to alleviate this problem. To ensure that the carrier-based aircraft have armored protection at the shortest take-off and landing distance, the ship does not use the front, middle and rear lift design, but uses two larger front and rear lifts. Not only maintain efficient take-off and landing efficiency but also different from the 'brilliant' class unprotected lift, the ship's lift is covered with two pieces of 25mm armor, which plays a certain role in protecting the fragile lift. Another design highlight of the ship's protection is that the hangar has storm discharge holes and detachable steel plates, which helps to alleviate the hull damage caused by the explosion of the armored aircraft carrier hangar. The waterline armor has also been strengthened to 114 mm to provide better protection for the hull. The underwater protection maintains the 'Joffre' design, and the torpedo protection bulkhead is slightly thickened. The ship plans to install four high-temperature steam turbines and six new supercharged boilers, capable of producing a power output of 150000 hp."

The ship plans to install eight dual-equipped 100 mm/55 Model 1940  dual-purpose guns, which will be arranged on the front and rear sides of the ship. The gun is a growth version of Model 1933. The barrel uses a self-tightening integral type, with a semi-automatic sliding wedge locking machine, and the firing speed, power, and range have been improved. Five are installed before and after the island, and three are installed on the port side, with a total of eight double-mounted 37 mm/70 models 1935 anti-aircraft guns. In addition, 20 dual-mounted 20 mm anti-aircraft guns are placed all over the ship's hull. For the first time, the Foch class began to use advanced microwave surface search radar with an accuracy of 200 yards and a resolution of 400 yards. It can detect low-altitude bombers below 500 feet within 15 nautical miles, battleships within 22 nautical miles, or destroyers within 15 nautical miles. At the same time, the installation of SM radar can search aircraft at an altitude of 10000 feet within 50 nautical miles and battleships within 25 nautical miles with an accuracy of 500 to 200 yards and a resolution of 200 yards. this radar is also the first batch of fighter deployment radar, which can effectively deploy fighters to intercept enemy aircraft, together with additional return signal devices, the ship's radar system has reached a very advanced level."

With the progress of the war, the French naval air force is constantly updating the establishment of the air brigade to meet the strong demand for air supremacy in the war. The typical Foch class aircraft carrier aviation brigade consists of a fighter squadron of 36 fighters, a reconnaissance bomber squadron of 12, a dive bomber squadron of 18, and a torpedo bomber squadron of 18, with a total of 84 aircraft. Foch's official service is undoubtedly bad news for the Stahl Pact allies, her excellent reconnaissance capabilities, air defense capabilities, and a large fleet of carrier-based aircraft provide both shields and blades for the French fleet, and the strong armor makes it more difficult for her to be hurt. Now, she will lead a powerful mobile task force cruising the vast ocean in search of unlucky prey. Be careful, the ships of the allies of the Stahl Pact!"

In several experimental landing operations, the French army found that although the main gun power of destroyers and light cruisers was less than that of heavy cruisers, their faster firing speed could form a firepower advantage on the other side in a short time, but it was more efficient than cruisers. To gain an overwhelming advantage over German heavy cruisers, the French navy decided to develop a new type of 240mm rapid-fire main gun. The new gun was originally planned to be installed on the St. Louis class heavy cruiser, but it was calculated that the new turret was so heavy that the ship's hull needed a major overhaul. Therefore, the French Navy decided to further develop the C5A3 and C5SA1 projects to give full play to the full effectiveness of the new artillery, code-named C6."

 fn.56.d: "The new ship is equipped with 240mm quick-firing artillery, which is a fully enhanced version of the St. Louis-class 203mm gun, with a great increase in power and firing speed. In the past, the sub-loading projectile used by naval guns is helpful to control the range and power, but the firing speed is too slow. To improve the firing speed, the new main gun adopts fixed loading and automatic loading system for the first time. The gun pitch and rotation are all electrically driven, which can be loaded at any angle and can be fired into the air. It uses an air tank to provide air pressure to open and close the latch. It takes only 8 seconds to load and can fire at an astonishing speed of 8 shots per minute. The gun is the first batch of artillery developed by the French navy to use sliding gaskets. The gun body uses a self-tightening integral type, the chrome-plated sliding gasket is fixed by a gasket locking ring, and the wedge-shaped vertical sliding tail block is used instead of the traditional intermittent screw. when using a heavy charge, the initial velocity of the projectile can reach 845m / s, and the maximum range can reach 36km at an elevation of 40 degrees. The new ship plans to be equipped with nine of this type of artillery, three combined with three pieces of artillery, and a layout of "front, second and rear one". Due to the use of a complex automatic loading system and thicker armor, the weight of the turret is significantly higher than that of the 'St. Louis' class, each weighing 730 tons. With the support of the advanced automatic loading system, the theoretical ammunition delivery capacity of the ship can reach a terrible 13 tons per minute, and its firepower is comparable to that of a battleship."

The specific design is as follows: 12-degree tilted 170mm waterline armor, the lower end is gradually thinned to 102mm. Horizontal protection has two layers, the upper layer is 35mm deck armor, the lower layer is 90mm main horizontal armor. The protection of the main turret is 240mm in the front, 110mm in the side, 114mm in the top, 110mm in the back, and 200mm on the seat. The front and top of the command tower armor are 180mm and 102mm respectively. The whole ship uses a complete armored box layout, with a total armor weight of 3560 tons, with a stronger level of protection than all other heavy cruisers in the world.

The gun adopts a double-mounted CAD, turret with a rotation speed of up to 25 degrees per second, and is equipped with a vertical wedge semi-automatic latch and an electric push rod to be loaded with a lifting machine. it can be loaded at any angle and the firing speed is as high as 20 rounds per minute. The gun is guided by a new type of air defense fire control radar and commanded by the RPC system. When carrying out air defense tasks, it uses radio proximity fuze high explosive projectiles, and the initial velocity of the projectiles can reach 870m / s. When firing at ships, it fires armor-piercing projectiles with an initial velocity of 855m / s and a maximum range of 18000 meters. In terms of medium-range air defense, the ship uses a more powerful 57mm/60 Model 1943 anti-aircraft gun to replace the original 37mm gun. The new anti-aircraft gun is installed in a double-mounted ACAD. The turret weighs 18 tons and uses 2.96kg (6.5lb) heavy projectiles with an initial velocity of 850m / s, a firing speed of 120m / min, a maximum range of 14500 m, and a maximum range of 5500 m at a muzzle elevation of 90 degrees. The anti-aircraft gun is controlled by the new DRBC- 30B radar fire control director and can track the target automatically. To face a greater air threat, the ship is expected to install six dual-mounted 127mm/54  guns (on both sides of the front and rear hull) and eight 57mm/60 anti-aircraft guns (on both sides), as well as several new radars to detect targets and guide fire control."

For the French navy, which has a long tradition, it has to accept this figure, because weak finances and shortage of supplies make it impossible for it to compete for expensive main ships. After the Treaty of Versailles, the French navy learned a lot from the Germans, especially in the case of large destroyers, and successfully combined them with their ships. the result is that the French navy's destroyer leader is one of the most powerful destroyers. However, the good times are not long, the Italians are getting closer and closer, and they want to use light cruisers to hunt down the destroyer leader, which makes the French urgently need an upgraded destroyer leader so that the French navy will not waver."

With the support of this propulsion mode, the new torpedo can reach a maximum speed of 46 knots, with a range of 3000 meters and a maximum range of 13 kilometers at 35 knots.

This incident made the French realize two things: first, the serious lack of anti-air firepower of France's existing ships; second, the importance of aircraft carriers to future naval warfare. When the French realized this, they found that they had already lagged behind Britain, the United States and Japan in these two aspects, in addition to stepping up the construction of new aircraft carriers and the study of new anti-air weapons, the transformation of old weapons is also a good way. The Navy thought of the De Grasse class, a new light cruiser that had not yet been finalized last year, and the design of the whole ship was nearing completion.

The secondary gun is equipped with four dual-equipped 100mm/55 Model 1940  dual-purpose guns, and the anti-aircraft weapons are 8 dual-equipped 37mm/70 Model 1935 anti-aircraft guns, 20 single Erie air defense guns, and 2 triple 533mm torpedoes. The use of 2 sets of high-temperature steam turbines and 6 supercharged boilers, coupled with integrated smoke exhaust pipes, can output an astonishing 120000 hp, providing a limit speed of 34.5 knots for the whole ship."

The detailed indicators are as follows: length: 189.6m. Standard displacement: 12000 tons. Fully loaded displacement: 15000 tons. Main gun: 12 152mm/55 Model 1935 guns, 4x3 'front 2 rear 2' layout, theoretical firing rate 10 shots / min. Secondary guns: 8 100mm/55 Model 1940 dual-purpose guns, 4x2, arranged on both sides of the hull. Anti-aircraft gun: 16 37mm/70 Model 1935 anti-aircraft guns, 8x2, of which 6 are arranged on both sides and 2 on the inside of the front and rear main turrets. The 20mm is equipped with 24 Oerlikon cannon, which are arranged all over the hull of the ship.

The strong ability to break through and harass makes it a problem that the French have to face. The C4 cruiser is out of date, and the achievement of the C5 program has become the fresh blood that the French navy urgently needs. It brings the last pride of the French, but the draft of the C5 design was defeated one by one. When many enterprises were unable to complete this task, C5SA1 appeared. The only difference is the air defense firepower. We are proud to use a 13.2mm machine gun 37mm medium-range air defense weapon after all. Or division Yi long skill to control Yi, using 20mm's MK4 MK20 anti-aircraft gun and 40mm's Bowers anti-aircraft gun.

 fn.42.t: "C5A3 program - hull armour"
 fn.42.d: "In the early 1930s, in response to the Italian Zara-class heavy cruisers, we built the Algeria class heavy cruiser with equally excellent protection. Although its treaty-based design scheme has been unable to meet the current requirements, its design ideas can still be used as a good reference. In the end, the protection design of the new ship followed the Algeria-class system, which was comprehensively strengthened on the basis of it, and became a new protection standard for heavy cruisers after the French navy got rid of the restrictions of the treaty. The specific design is as follows: the waterline armor is 150mm, the surface hardened armor is used to peel off the armor-piercing projectile cap, the tilt is 10 degrees, and the lower end is gradually reduced to 80mm; the horizontal protection is a single layer of 70mm horizontal uniform armor deck, and the top of the ammunition depot is strengthened to 90mm. The protection of the main turret is 203mm for the front, 100mm to 120mm for the side, 102mm for the top, 90mm for the rear, and 160mm for the seat. The front and top of the command tower armor are 160mm and 102mm respectively, with a total armor weight of 2700 tons. Underwater protection adopts double bottom protection, with a multi torpedo protection compartment and watertight compartment, which has also become the new standard underwater protection scheme of French navy cruisers."

 fn.43.t: "Weapons and performance"
 fn.43.d: "The first threat to the new ship is the new German heavy cruiser equipped with 203mm/60 SK C/34 artillery. To gain the upper hand in the artillery battle, firepower advantage is essential in addition to excellent protection. The ship's main firepower is three triplets, with a total of nine new 203mm/55 Mle 1934 guns. The gun is 11.5 meters long and weighs 17.4 tons. The armor-piercing projectile used weighs 140 kilograms. The initial velocity can reach 844 meters per second when fired with a heavy charge, and the maximum range is 32 kilometers at a 40-degree elevation. In the actual test, the gun can penetrate 270mm vertical surface hardened armor at 10000 (20000) meters and 70mm horizontal homogeneous armor at 20000 meters. The maximum firing speed is 5 rounds/min, and it can reach 4 rounds/min in actual combat. Since the naval exercise in 1937, the French navy has attached great importance to the ability of ship air defense. The secondary gun and outer air defense firepower of the new ship adopts seven duplex 100mm/45 Mle 1933  dual-purpose guns, which have been widely used in a large number of new battleships, aircraft carriers and cruisers with good performance and high reliability. After careful study, comparison, and testing, the French navy finally chose its 37mm/70 anti-aircraft guns and imported Swiss 20mm Erlihole guns as medium-and short-range air defense weapons, equipped with a total of 6 dual 37mm/70 anti-aircraft guns and 8 twin and 12 single-mounted 20mm Oerlikon guns, so the ship's air defense capability is very excellent. Finally, the ship will be equipped with two triple 550mm torpedo launchers to effectively attack enemy ships in night combat or close combat."

Despite this, the Supreme Council still approved the construction plans of nine heavy cruisers of this class, of which the No. 1 ship was named St. Louis, named after the perfect king in the history of France. The official service of St. Louis is a timely help to the French navy, which finally alleviates the dire situation of France's serious shortage of heavy cruisers. With high speed and excellent arms, she was able to effectively counter the German cruiser fleet and eliminate threats from the sea and the sky.

Now, we finally have a chance to realize one of the early plans for the 'Richelieu' class, which was to use a triple 406mm main gun. Rumor has it that Imperial Japan is secretly building a super battleship with firepower and armor far beyond current standards. The new 406mm/50 Model 1938 guns have greater armor erosion and greater power, actually tested at 20,000 (30,000) meters, eroding 515 (386) mm of horizontal armor and 95 (159) mm of vertical armor, more than enough to deal with potential threats. Due to weight constraints, the new ship was planned to be fitted with two new 406mm main guns, with the secondary guns continuing to use three triple 152mm/55 Model 1935 guns, with the same layout of the main and secondary guns as the 'Gascony'. In order to cope with the threat of a large number of Japanese naval aviation, the new ship focuses on strengthening the anti-aircraft firepower, and is expected to install eight twin 100mm/45 Model 1933 anti-aircraft guns (arranged on both sides of the hull), twelve twin 37mm/70 Model 1935 anti-aircraft guns (arranged on both sides of the forward secondary guns, both sides of the port side, and on both sides of the aft secondary guns), and twenty twin 20mm Erlikon anti-aircraft guns (arranged all over the hull), as well as installing the latest search and fire control radar, the air defense capability is the strongest among the 'Richelieu' class. According to the strategic plan, the ship will be the core force against the enemy surface fleet and serve as the flagship of the entire French Indochina fleet, and the Duke of Richelieu has suggested that it be named 'Champagne'."

 FRA_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Lebel Mle M93"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Lebel is an 8mm bolt action rifle that has entered French military service since 1887. The world's first firearm to utilise smokeless powder, the rifle is known for its durability and long range. The primary weapon of the French soldier in the trenches of the Weltkrieg; large quantities of the rifle still exist even now under the new regime of the Commune."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1: "MAS Modèle 1936"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "MAS-36"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The proximity of France to the destested German Empire has hastened the call for a more modern bolt action rifle. The new MAS 36 rifle has been chosen by the Commune as the new bolt-action rifle for the revolution. A short 'carbine' style rifle that features dirt resistance and is relatively cheap to produce; the MAS 36 shall serve as the new standard arm to defend France from all her enemies."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2: "MAS Modèle 1938"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "MAS-38"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Following the end of the Weltkrieg, a small arms development programme took place in the Service Technique de l'Armement. With the help of MAS (the weapon's industry, the MAS 38 would be France's first submachine gun. An extremely high quality weapon, the MAS 38 features a fire rate of 650 rounds per minute although its appearance is rather odd given its unorthodox layout."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_3: "MAS Modèle 1940/42"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "MAS-40/42"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The MAS-40/42 is the latest in a series of Communard semi-automatic rifles. Unlike its predecessors, however, the MAS-40/42 was found to be exceptionally reliable in French military testing. The original five round internal magazine, however, was deemed insufficient and a new variant of the MAS-40/42, the 40/42, was developed featuring a detachable ten round box magazine."
 FRA_support_weapons: "FM Chauchat & Brandt Mle 27/31"
 FRA_support_weapons_desc: "Tried and tested in the trenches of the Weltkrieg, the Chauchat has long been hated by the French infantryman. However, despite the hatred for this weapon, when it is not jammed with dirt and mud, the gun is quite reliable to control, and the Chauchat can be fired from the hip as well. The Brandt mortar is a relic from the Weltkrieg, a refinement of the British 'Stokes' trench mortar. A simple and effective weapon, the mortar can be dissembled into three parts and requires a crew of ten."
 FRA_support_weapons2: "Hotchkiss M1922 & Brandt Mle 27/31"
 FRA_support_weapons2_desc: "A sturdy and reliable weapon, the Hotchkiss M1922 is a light machine gun developed by Hotchkiss. Capable of firing 450 rounds per minute, the gun has a regulator that can adjust the rate of fire. The Hotchkiss can be fed from an overhead magazine or 15/24/30 round feed strips."
 FRA_support_weapons3: "Chatelleraut FM Mle 24/29 & Brandt Mle 35/38"
 FRA_support_weapons3_desc: "It is clear to the command of the Commune that the Chauchat and Hotchkiss are seriously outdated. Our designers have come up with a much lighter gun in preparation for the coming war than the Hotchkiss. While the Chatelleraut features a low fire rate, it is a robust and reliable weapon; well-liked by our troops for its consistency and weight. The Brandt Mle 35 is a 60mm mortar to be used by infantry companies for indirect fire. Simple and effective, it only requires a crew of five to operate."
 FRA_support_weapons4: "MAS AA-42 & Brandt Mle 1942"
 FRA_support_weapons4_desc: "Experience in the Second Weltkrieg has led to an interest in general purpose machine guns to serve a variety of tactical roles. With nearly double the rate of fire of the Chatelleraut, the AA-42 is a belt-fed monster that will mow down anything in its path. The Mle 42 is a considerable improvement over its predecessor, with an emphasis on a greater close quarters support weapon."
 FRA_infantry_at: "Canon de 75mm mle 1897 modifee 1933"
 FRA_infantry_at_desc: "The beloved French 75mm is a field gun developed for anti personal usage. While maintaing the shield and wheels of the original field gun, this variant has increased elevation and a 58 degree traverse."
 FRA_infantry_at2: "LRAC de 73mm Mle 1943"
 FRA_infantry_at2_desc: "An anti-tank rocket launcher, the LRAC can fire a 73mm high explosive antitank projectile capable of penetrating over 11 inches of rolled homogenous armour. The fear of every German tank crew, the LRAC has a shield to protect the operator from the rocket's back blast."
 FRA_infantry_weapons2: "RSC 1938 Carbine"
 FRA_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The RSC (Fusil Automatique Modele) is a semi-automatic rifle. While earlier varients were long and limited mobility, the carbine version allows for greater movement on the battlefield. This 1938 version features numerous changes to its predecessors such as simpler production, takedown, and cleaning of the rifle."
 FRA_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "MAS-36 LG39"
 FRA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "This variant of the MAS-36 comes equipped with a folding hollow aluminium stock and strengthened barrel. It can also be used for grenade launching purposes as it comes with a 48mm grenade launcher."
 FRA_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "CEAM Modele 1944"
 FRA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "A secret design copied from the German line of assualt rifles, the CEAM Modele 1944 is France's first assualt rifle. Chambered in 0.30 carbine rounds, the rifle even comes with a bipod and a folding buttstock."

 NFA_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Lebel Mle M93"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mle 1886 Lebel rifle is the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition. This propellant powder, made of stabilised nitrocellulose, is called "Poudre B" ("Powder B") and was invented in 1884 by Paul Vieille. In 1893, an improved version of the M1886 Lebel was designated "Fusil Mle 1886 Modifié 93" and was one of the main rifles of the French Army in the Weltkrieg. The Lebel rifle is quite accurate up to 300 yards and still deadly at three times that distance, but has its flaws, such as slow-to-reload tube magazine and lack of a wooden handguard on top of the barrel."
 #Bethrier M34:
 NFA_infantry_equipment_1: "Fusil Berthier Modèle 1915 modifié 32"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Berthier Mle M32"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the Weltkrieg, the French military recognised the need to replace the 8mm Lebel cartridge, which is poorly suited to large-capacity rifle magazines and to automatic weapons. After the replacement of the cartridge by the Commune, a modern 7.5mm Mle 1931 rimless cartridge was finally introduced - mostly copying the Communard 7.5mm Mle 1929 cartridge. The Berthier rifle, which quickly became the main rifle of the French army after its retreat to Algeria, was modified in 1932 to use Mauser type magazines and another new cartridge."
 NFA_infantry_equipment_2: "Carabine-Mitrailleuses Hotchkiss Type M2"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Hotchkiss Mle CMH2"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "The CMH2 is an ambitiously-engineered and well-built submachine gun submitted by Hotchkiss in 1938 as the Type 017, which entered service as the Carabine-Mitrailleuses Hotchkiss Type M2 (along with its police variant Type M1). The CMH2's extreme compactness is both its best and worst feature - the complexity of having every protruding part fold or retract make the weapon expensive to produce and also reduces ergonomics, which isn't ideal for quick target acquisition."
 #MAS 55 combined with MAT-49 police variant:
 NFA_infantry_equipment_3: "Fusil MAT Modèle 43"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "MAT Mle 43"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Fusil MAT Modèle 43 is an automatic rifle, using a 7.5x54mm cartridge and a foldable magazine, which allows it to be a little more compact than its regular counterparts. Along with this, the MAT-43 is produced by machine-stamping process which allows the economical production of large numbers of rifles, then urgently required by the French Government. Despite some issues with rate of fire and reliability, the MAT-43 is considered as the next step in personal weapons."
 NFA_support_weapons: "Mitrailleuse Darne Mle 1919 & Mortier Stokes"
 NFA_support_weapons_short: "Darne Mle 1919 & Mortier Stokes"
 NFA_support_weapons_desc: "The Darne Mle 1919 is a light machine gun of French origin. It is gas operated, firing from open bolt in fully automatic only (at an incredible rate of 1100 rounds per minute). The Darne machine gun has an unusual belt feed between the gas piston and barrel, using the two-stage cartridge feed system (cartridge withdrawn from the belt to the rear, and then pushed forward into the barrel). It is chambered in French 7.5mm Mle 1931. The Stokes mortar is a Weltkrieg-era mortar known for its reliability and rate of fire."
 NFA_support_weapons2: "Mitrailleuse Hotchkiss Mle 1926 & Mortier Brandt Mle 27/31"
 NFA_support_weapons2_desc: "The Hotchkiss Mle 1926 served as a replacement for the Darne Mle 1919. While the Hotchkiss's rate of fire was significantly lower than the Darne, its stability and ease of production makes it a more preferred light machine gun. The Brandt mortar is the first in the family of mortars by Edgar Brandt. A simple and effective weapon that has a metal tube to reduce recoil, the Brandt Mortar is able to dish out nearly 18 rounds a minute."
 NFA_support_weapons2_short: "Hotchkiss Mle 1926 & Brandt Mle 27/31"

 NFA_support_weapons3_short: "Hotchkiss Mle 26/37 & Brandt Mle 35/38"
 NFA_support_weapons3_desc: "The 1937 version of the Hotchkiss machine gun features an increased rate of fire as its predecessor while maintaining the gun's low recoil. The Brandt Mle 35/38 also features improvements to the mortar system to reduce the mortar's recoil and improve its accuracy."
 NFA_support_weapons4: "Mitrailleuse Hotchkiss Mle 26/41 & Mortier Brandt Mle 1942"
 NFA_support_weapons4_short: "Hotchkiss Mle 26/41 & Brandt Mle 42"
 NFA_support_weapons4_desc: "The 41 version of the Hotchkiss features a telescopic sight and a slight increase in rate of fire, allowing the gun to be effective in close quarters while maintaining accuracy. The 1942 version of the Brandt mortar has a slight improvement in its rate of fire making it an effective close range support weapon."
 NFA_infantry_weapons2: "BSA M1926 'Thompson Submachine Gun'"
 NFA_infantry_weapons2_desc: "As part of the French Exiles' cooperation with the Entente, the French forces have adopted the BSA M1926. The BSA M1926 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines. The gun has been well received and praised by the French infantry who value its incredible stopping power."
 NFA_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 NFA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The Lanchester is a submachine gun of Canadian origin, a near carbon copy based on the German MP28. As part of Anglo-French cooperation, number of the Lanchester were sent to National French forces in Africa and loyalist cells on the mainland."
 NFA_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "De Lisle Carbine"
 NFA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "This weapon has achieved popularity amongst those in the special forces. The weapon is a Frankenstein of a weapon, as it combines features from both the SMLE and the MI1928AI. Fitted with an internal suppressor, the gun is extremely quiet which makes it perfect for partisan action or assassination."

 NFA_motorized_equipment_1_short: "S-20TL"
 NFA_motorized_equipment_1_desc: "In 1934, the French army ordered S-35C trucks from Laffly - a cumbersome six-wheel drive vehicle, unpopular with crews. The new Laffly S-20TL, proposed (and adopted) a year later, is generally superior to the previous S-35C, has a better power-to-weight ratio, and offers ample storage boxes in which passengers can store equipment. The truck is recognised as more innovative compared to its Communard analogue, due to only one body type being needed to transport different types of platoons, which allows the C-20TL to be mass-produced in large quantities, even in colonies."
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_1: "Citroën Tracteur Semi-Chenille P-107"
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_1_short: "P-107"
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "After the Weltkrieg, Citroën developed a long line of half-tracks based on the Kégresse patent. In 1937, the company introduced its newer and more powerful P-107 model as a successor to the Citroën-Kégresse P-17. The P-107 has two main variants: a light prime mover for artillery guns, and a platform cargo transport for units. Many commanders use them in various standard and non-standard roles, which makes the P-107 a versatile truck."

 NFA_mechanized_equipment_2_desc: "The Tracteur Chenillé Modèle 39, developed by Berliet in 1938 and adopted in 1941 after numerous modifications, is a tracked carrier with a total capacity of ten people: 1 driver and 9 passengers. Unlike the 1938 model, which was equipped with a trailer for transporting main part of troops, the final variant has extended cargo hold with high box-like armoured superstructures with doors at their back, protecting the platoon on the way to the battlefield. Despite rumours that the TC-39 was largely inspired by the designs of Commune (or even a direct copy), it was adopted by the French army."

 NFA_mechanized_equipment_3_desc: "The Véhicule de Transport de Troupes Blindé - Renault is a closed tracked carrier vehicle developed in 1941, when the Army had doubts that Berliet would be able to meet army specifications for its TC-39. Originally introduced in 1942, the VTTB-R was rejected due to its low capacity and was only accepted into service after increasing the total capacity to 11 people, including the driver. Considered by many specialists to be the one of most modern personnel carriers, the VTTB-R is quite expensive to manufacture."

The project was abandoned until 1939, when the French army requested an amphibious vehicle. Updated as an amphibious transport with a capacity of 10 people, the S-40 was introduced in 1941 and adopted, despite worse characteristics than the Communard counterpart."

 NFA_armored_car_equipment_1_short: "AM-40"
 NFA_armored_car_equipment_1_desc: "The Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1940, designed by Louis Delyagard to the 1938 specifications of the French army, is a very innovative low profile armoured car with 8-wheel drive and monocoque 2-man body. The process of development of the AM-40 was accompanied by constant design modifications, but with a change in the geopolitical situation, despite the demands of the military to equip the car with a 47-mm cannon, the version with a 20-mm cannon was adopted in 1940."
 #Combined CDM Armoured Car and Panhard AML (body from AML and tower from CDM):
 NFA_armored_car_equipment_2: "Citroën Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1942"
 NFA_armored_car_equipment_2_short: "AM-42"
 NFA_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "After evaluating the use of the heavy and complex AM-40, the General Staff stated that it needed a lighter and even faster reconnaissance vehicle to patrol colonial areas and perform many other tasks available for cheaper vehicles. Citroën engineers, after a detailed study of Canadian armoured cars, developed the Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1942 to meet the requirements of the army. The new AM-42, a lightweight 4-wheeled vehicle armed with a 20mm cannon, was warmly received by French soldiers."
 #Combined Panhard AM 40 P and Panhard AML, also 47mm gun (body from AML and tower from Panhard):
 NFA_armored_car_at_equipment: "Citroën Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1942 Canon de 47mm"
 NFA_armored_car_at_equipment_short: "AM-42-C47"
 NFA_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "The Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1942 Canon de 47mm is a combined product of Louis Delyagard and other Citroën engineers who installed a 47mm cannon on the AM-40 tower. Like the replacement of the AM-40 in service with the AM-42, the new tower was also mounted on its hull, which made the AM-42 a tank hunter in accordance with the original requirements of the army for the AM-40."

 ###Artillery
 NFA_artillery_equipment_1: "Matériel de 75mm Modèle 1897"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_1_short: "Matériel de 75mm"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The Matériel de 75mm Mle 1897, also known as the French 75 or 'Soixante-Quinze' ('seventy-five'), is widely regarded as the first modern artillery piece. In service since 1898, the Soixante-Quinze was heavily used in the Weltkrieg, where it was used as an anti-personnel, anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapon. After the retreat to Algeria, the French army continued to use these weapons, mainly because they still mostly meet modern criteria."
 #Canon de 105 court mle 1934 Schneider:
 NFA_artillery_equipment_2: "Matériel de 105mm Court Modèle 1935 Schneider"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_2_short: "Matériel de 105mm C S"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Matériel de 105mm Court Mle 1935 is a conservative design by Schneider. Developed to replace Soixante-Quinze in service, the Matériel de 105mm is more a howitzer than a cannon, and is primarily intended to destroy enemy fortifications."
 NFA_artillery_equipment_3: "Canon de 155mm Grande Puissance Filloux Modèle 1917/1942"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_3_short: "Canon de 155mm GPF"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "The Canon de 155mm Grande Puissance Filloux Modèle 1917, also known as the GPF, was developed during the Weltkrieg by Colonel Louis Filloux to meet the urgent need for modern heavy artillery, and is used by both the Communard and the National governments. Due to problems with the production of GPFs in the colonies by the French government, only a limited numbers were in service until 1942, when the GPF design was updated to facilitate production and meet modern standards."

 #25mm SA 34:
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Matériel de 25mm Semi-Automatique Modèle 1934"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "Matériel de 25mm SA"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "By the early 1920s, the French Army had come to the realisation that the armour-piercing capability of the 37mm TRP infantry gun would be insufficient against modern tanks. In 1926 Hotchkiss proposed a 25mm gun design, which was not immediately adopted due to financial issues, and the availability of the Matériel de 75mm. The Matériel de 25mm, which entered service only in 1936 with the realisation of the approaching battle for France, is a reliable weapon inspired by the Filloux concept."
 #Modified Matériel de 75mm Modèle 1897:
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Matériel Antichar de 75mm Modèle 1897/1937"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "Matériel de 75mm AC"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "With the adoption of the Matériel de 105mm, the old Matériel de 75mm were mainly redesigned into anti-tank guns with an updated chassis. Considered too heavy for modern anti-tank guns, the Soixante-Quinze have higher penetration than their counterparts."
 #Very modified Matériel de 75mm:
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Matériel Antichar de 75mm Semi-Automatique Modèle 1943"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "Matériel de 75mm AC SA"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The Matériel de 75mm SA is a new semi-automatic gun based on the 75mm Matériel de 75mm AC cannon. With a higher rate of fire, the Matériel de 75mm CA SA is still a slightly outdated weapon, but can compete with its modern counterparts, thanks to a modernised mechanism and a new approach to the chassis design."

 #Hotchkiss 25mm:
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_1: "Mitrailleuse de 25mm Contre-Aéroplanes Modèle 1936"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "Mitrailleuse 25mm CA"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "After the retreat to Algeria, the French military announced the need for a specialised anti-aircraft autocannon. Hotchkiss introduced the 25 mm project in 1936, which was adopted due to the slow development of a more promising Schneider variant. Despite the acceptance of the Mitrailleuse 25mm CA into service, the original tripod was replaced to a triangular base with a two-wheel carriage as per the army's request."
 #Schneider 37 mm:
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_2: "Mitrailleuse de 37 mm Contre-Aérien Modèle 1939"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "Mitrailleuse 37mm CA"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "Developed since 1930, the Mitrailleuse 37mm CA was finally ready for production in 1939. After a bitter controversy with the French military, who had already adopted the Hotchkiss variant, the Mitrailleuse 37mm CA from Schneider was adopted after initial testing as a more advanced variant than the Hotchkiss's 25mm gun."
 #Canon de 75 CA modèle 1940 Schneider:
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_3: "Matériel de 75mm Contre-Aérien Modèle 1940"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "Matériel de 75mm CA"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "During the late 1920s, it was realised that the Matériel de 75mm Modèle 1897 was outdated as an anti-aircraft weapon and development of a new gun was begun in 1931. The Matériel de 75mm Contre-Aérien Modèle 1940 by Schneider has faster rate of fire, higher muzzle velocity, increased vertical range, modern fire control and greater mobility with new gun carriages, than the old Soixante-Quinze. Impressed by the performance of the former Mitrailleuse 37mm CA from Schneider, the French command quickly adopted the new 75mm gun."

 NFA_gw_tank_equipment_short: "FT-29"
 NFA_light_tank_equipment_0_short: "FT-29"
 NFA_gw_tank_equipment_desc: "The FT was the first production tank to have its armament within a fully rotating turret and was revolutionary in terms of tank designs, later copied by other countries. Renault's design, developed in 1917, was technically far more advanced than the other two French tanks of the Weltkrieg. The French army, after retreat to Algeria, modified remaining tanks with the Hotchkiss Mle 26 machine gun in 1929, but in general, many of the FTs were sold to other countries to support the French budget."
 NFA_light_tank_equipment_1: "Char de Manœuvre Renault Modèle 1930"
 NFA_light_tank_equipment_1_short: "CMR-30"
 NFA_light_tank_equipment_1_desc: "In 1926, Renault has obtained an order to build two new prototypes as a parallel modification project, with the factory designation Renault NC. In 1930, Renault succeeded in his attempt to get his Renault NC accepted as the basis for further light infantry tank development, the final result of which was adopted by the army in 1932, under the name Char de Manœuvre Renault Modèle 1930. A new tank based largely on revision of the original design of the Renault FT, and armed with a Puteaux SA Mle 18 cannon and two Hotchkiss Mle 26 machine guns. By request of the French army, the tanks have a radio operator's assigned position, and are equipped with a huge and characteristic twin-boom antenna. Due to this unusual feature, the tower has a reduced traverse of approximately 345°."
 NFA_light_tank_equipment_2: "Char de Manœuvre d'Ensemble Renault Modèle 1935"
 NFA_light_tank_equipment_2_short: "CMER-35"
 NFA_light_tank_equipment_2_desc: "With the development of the CMR-30 tank, which had already departed from purely infantry support, the French army ordered a new tank that could fight enemy counterparts. Renault requested funding for a development of the new tank that was turned down, until they presented a prototype. The Renault UZ prototype was introduced in 1935 and immediately was accepted in service as Char de Manœuvre d'Ensemble Renault Modèle 1935 due to financial problems of the French government, but in limited numbers. In many ways, the CMER-35 is a slightly enlarged model of the CMR-30, retaining many of the features of the previous vehicle, but with increased armour and armed with a 47mm cannon."
 NFA_light_tank_equipment_3: "Char Léger de Combat Citroën"
 NFA_light_tank_equipment_3_short: "CLC-C"
 NFA_light_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The Char Léger de Combat Citroën is a light tank created by the request of the French Army for a lightly armoured heavy combat vehicle. The CLC-C has an oscillating turret with a cupola for the gunner, located along the turret centreline. The turret itself is offset to the left, in order to make room for a driver's compartment in the hull, and is armed with a magazine 90-mm cannon on the right side. Of the significant drawbacks of the new tank, it can be noted that the breech is located outside the turret, which means that the gunner can reload it only by venturing outside of the tank."

The CdC G1-R is one of the most advanced French tanks, providing good armament and mobility and suitable for multiple roles. Armed with 75mm and 47mm guns, the tank was not in line with the original French army standards, but after several changes in the specifications, the CdC G1-R was adopted in service.
