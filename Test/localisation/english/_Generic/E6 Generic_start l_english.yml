 intro.0.desc: "Credit: Part of Germany design, setting, flags, and some of icons are from famous Fuhrerreich Mod and TNO(the new order) Mod. Please check it on the steam workshop if you like it. \n This mod is a TypeMoon-themed and Anime-themed mod, try to blend the WWII world, or the historical world, with characters from TypeMoon ACG series, especially Fate Series, made by a small group lead by Entarogan. This mod does not adopt the original type-moon universe and keep the realistic WWII universe instead. Concepts like servant, Grail War and Root, do not make sense here. Grail, Alaya, Magic, etc. should be interpreted as religious and political symbols. \n All ideologies, religious,racial,national ideas are simulations of those real exsits in history or TM original works and are not any real ideas held by any one of authors. The authors are opposite to all kinds of racism,fascism,nazism,terrorism and respect every nation and religion beliefs.\n Forgive me for my Chinglish please."

 intro.3.t: "AI Behavior Correction"
 intro.3.desc: "Due to some reasons that only Paradox programmers know, the AI controlled countries won't correctly build divisions designed by the MOD author automatically and then stay unarmed. Save and load this game at this moment could refresh AIs and solve this problem. If you want an exciting gameplay experience, we plea for a Save-Load now."

 intro.5.t: "Common Problems After Actual Gameplay"
 intro.5.desc: "-Q：Why can't I always beat Siegfried？ \n --A：He is the number one villain in MOD settings，Having numerous ideas and the most cumbersome Ai strategic inclination settings。 \n\n-Q：But I see he's clearly cheating，Suddenly adding key technologies and deploying additional troops！ \n --A：All major AI countries will refresh their technology at a fixed point in time，But [GER. GetNameDef] will indeed refresh six months ahead of other major countries，After all, it is the most evil Ai。As for the sudden appearance of AI troops，Currently, only [GER. GetNameDef] [ENG. GetNameDef] [JAP. GetNameDef]'s Ai will have additional troops when threatened on the ground，Among them, [GER. GetNameDef] and [JAP. GetNameDef] are 5 infantry+5 support companies，[ENG. GetNameDef] is 5 mechanized infantry+5 support company，Both [SOV. GetNameDef] and [RUS. GetNameDef] will deploy 9 infantry, 3 artillery, and 5 support companies through player visible resolutions until a certain maximum number of troops is reached. \n\n"
 intro.5.a: "Understood." 
 intro.5.b: "Why is Ai still having a bunch of buffs hidden in the decision？！" 
 
 intro.6.t: "Common Problems After Actual Gameplay"
 intro.6.desc: "-Q：Why is Ai still having a bunch of buffs hidden in the decision？！ \n --A：These are all to compensate for Paradox Ai's inferior capabilities.\nThe dig_in_speed_factor is used to compensate for the difficulty in increasing trench values due to the easy mobilization of Ai troops.\nThe experience_gain_army_unit_factor and experience_loss factor enable the Ai unit to maintain a certain level of troop quality even after the commonly used large-scale head-on attacks.\nThe foolish behavior of attrition and supply_consumption_factor in avoiding Ai is completely unable to cope with losses and supply shortages.\nThe air_training_xp_Gain_factor, air_mission_xp_Gain_factor, and air_untrained_pilots_penalty_factor are both intended to compensate for the lack of training in the Ai Air Force. \n\nThe above terms will not actually lead to an overwhelming advantage for Ai in fighting against players. The truly unacceptable buff should be terms such as army.attack_factor and armydefence_factor that directly enhance attack defense. MOD did not include these things.\n\n"
 intro.6.a: "Understood." 
 intro.6.b: "Why does Ai have additional production bonuses?!" 
 
 intro.7.t: "Common Problems After Actual Gameplay"
 intro.7.desc: "-Q：Why does Ai have additional production bonuses？！ \n --A：These are still to compensate for Paradox Ai's inferior capabilities.\nParadox's Ai likes to modify the production line at will, making it difficult to utilize the production limit bonus. It can only be treated by adding production efficiency growth buffs.Nevertheless, the actual maximum production capacity of Ai has not changed because we did not include production_factory_max_efficacy_ factor, which would increase the maximum production capacity and seriously widen the production gap with players.\n\n"
 intro.7.a: "Understood." 
 intro.7.b: "You've changed so much, I can't even play anymore!"

 intro.8.t: "Common Problems After Actual Gameplay"
 intro.8.desc: "-Q：You've changed so much, I can't even play anymore! \n --A：At present, Mod recommends playing major countries, but if it is really difficult, you can first choose the "normal player" difficulty, use [HUN. GetNameDef], and ally with [GER. GetNameDef].Ai [GER. GetNameDef] is the best teacher on your map coloring road, and referencing its troop composition and equipment design will definitely defeat all enemies.\nAfterwards, you can try selecting [GER. GetNameDef] or its enemies, and try researching key technologies in advance and converting production capacity in a timely manner, so that the most advanced weapons can be put into the battlefield at the first time.\nNaval enthusiasts can choose [JAP. GetNameDef] or its enemies. [JAP. GetNameDef] can already achieve peace with the Allied powers after conquering the Pacific. As an enemy, they will no longer surrender due to atomic bombs and must engage in a landing campaign on Japanese soil!\n[SOV. GetNameDef] and [RUS. GetNameDef] please end the first war as soon as possible to gain more development time.\n\n"
