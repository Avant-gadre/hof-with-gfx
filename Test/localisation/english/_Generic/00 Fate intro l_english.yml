 POLITICS_NERO_CLAUDIUS_DESC: "For thousands of years, Nero has been the subject of historians and Christians, but the historical records of her own experiences are mostly indirect and suspicious. The Senate after the reconstruction of Rome is still in a tense relationship with Nero. Compared to the nobility, Nero Claudius prefers the average citizen. However, her populist political concept, her passionate personality, and her contempt for traditional ideas have brought her closer to the National Fascist Party."
