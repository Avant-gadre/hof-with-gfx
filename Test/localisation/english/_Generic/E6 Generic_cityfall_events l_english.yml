 worldnews.308.d.japan: "For the first time since the defeat of the Three Feudatories in 1681, the city of Kunming has fallen to a foreign invader. After losing the Wujiaba aerodrome to the southeast, [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] forces were gradually forced back along Lake Dian, only to finally break as the city's ancient walls were overrun.\n\nAs Japanese troops march beneath the iconic Jinma-Biji arches, their leaders must sit content with the knowledge that they control not only the prolific Kunming Arsenal, but also the terminus to the strategic Kunming-Haiphong Railway. Another great blow has been struck against China. Now that Japan has reached so far into the nation's interior, how many more can it take?"
 worldnews.308.a.japan: "The Chinese cannot flee from our advance!"
 worldnews.308.b.japan: "To the mountains! We will never surrender to them, never!"

 worldnews.309.t: "Zhang is Driven from Jinan!"
 worldnews.309.d_Zongchang: "Since 1925 the city of Jinan has come to mirror its master: corrupt and corpulent, brimming with vice and villainy. From his \"court\", Zhang Zongchang patronised everyone from artists and writers to playboys and prostitutes, executing any who crossed him, splitting heads as one might split melons. Everything was brought to an end as Jinan's defences collapsed earlier today.\n\nZhang himself could reportedly be heard bellowing above the din, perhaps overseeing the evacuation of his uncounted wealth. Now he is nowhere to be found, his harem abandoned, his sprawling mansion consumed by flames. Some say Zhang will return, either as a victor or in a coffin, a notion not without precedent. Once, despite defeat, he paraded through Jinan, sitting in a coffin and smoking a large cigar."
 worldnews.309.d_Tianran: "High upon Mount Tai, Zhang Tianran seemingly eschewed the ways of the world below, but in truth his reach stretched far beyond Shandong. Through the Yiguandao faith, his eyes and ears were everywhere, and often the sharp end of a knife.\n\nHowever, his followers are now in retreat, and even Mount Tai itself has been lost to a determined [FROM.GetName] offensive. The Shrine of the Blue Dawn, the Temple of the Jade King, and numerous other sacrosanct sites are now in the hands of irreverent soldiers; trampling through its sacred spaces, scattering statues, offerings, and incense; looting indiscriminately. Taishan may not recover for a generation, but Tianran's fate is anything but certain. This loss will no doubt incense his followers, and he has never been without a plan."
 worldnews.309.a: "Good riddance!"
 worldnews.309.b: "This is nothing but a tactical retreat!"
 worldnews.309.c: "An end to China's basest warlord?"
 worldnews.309.e: "An early end for a strange faith."

After a heavy bombardment, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective]s were forced to retreat into the Citadel of Qaitbay. Surrounded on all sides and with their only escape being the sea, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective]s made a desperate defence. However, with their supplies being limited and morale low, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] defenders had no choice but to offer their unconditional surrender to the victorious [FROM.GetAdjective] army. Despite the great victory however, the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces have pledged not to harm the city's historical buildings."

The place of great ancient wonders like the Library of Alexandria, the city is truly an important centre of life, culture, and industry for Egypt.\nHowever, the Ottomans have made tremendous progress in their war with Egypt and her Arab allies as Ottoman forces this morning have captured the city and the port. The Egyptian navy managed to flee before the Ottoman forces had arrived but the remaining defenders were unable to push the Ottomans back. Surrounded on all sides and facing the might of the Ottoman army, the Egyptians routed from the city - once again the Ottomans are now in control of the ancient city.

 worldnews.311.d: "The city of Tsaritsyn has been an important centre of transportation and commercial activity for centuries due to its location. Despite explosive population growth, the city's poor conditions had turned it into a hotbed of revolutionary activity. During the Russian Civil War, the town became the site of an important battle and siege, and likewise, history repeats itself once more, as the city has once again become a battlefield.\n\nLarge parts of the city lay in ruins as bitter urban warfare, and aerial bombardments have reduced much of the urban centres into ruin. Despite a near-fanatical resistance from [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces, the [FROM.GetAdjective] army announced today that the city has fallen into their hands."

 worldnews.312.d: "Nestled on the eastern side of Russia's Ural Mountains and bisected by the Iset River, the city of Yekaterinburg is notable for being a grand city connecting Russia's eastern and western halves. The city, named after the wife of Peter the Great, was also where the former Russian imperial family was imprisoned before their unfortunate execution.\n\nHard times seem to have fallen on the city once more however as [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces abandoned the city in the wake of the approaching [FROM.GetAdjective] armies. The [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] war effort has suffered a tremendous defeat with the loss of this critical junction connecting Europe and Asia and the valuable resources of the Urals."
