 fate_sustained_offensive: "Sustained Offensive"
 fate_sustained_offensive_desc: "While attacking with the advantage of a breakthrough often works, sooner or later the defence will take advantage of the attacker's exhaustion to regroup with a breather and rebuild their defences. However, with adequate reserves and good organisation, the attack can be extended deeper and devastate the enemy."

 fate_moblized_infantry: "Mobile Infantry"
 fate_moblized_infantry_desc: "In the face of advancing armour at high speeds, conventional infantry was too slow to follow up, too slow to react, and too weak to escape. The motorised/mechanised infantry, capable of keeping pace with modern warfare, was born."

 fate_depth_breakthrough_desc: "If a breakthrough is opened in the enemy's defences, it should be used to the fullest extent possible, advancing to the limits of the enemy's defences in a single huge wave of attack, making the enemy's defences incredibly difficult, irrelevant or even impossible."
 fate_long_range_strike: "Anti-armor priority"
 fate_long_range_strike_desc: "Armour-bomb confrontations between armoured units are becoming more frequent, and both tank design and armoured soldier training should focus around tank warfare."

 AIR_TIER_2_desc: "Any Section can be started at any time and do not require other sections to be completed first"

 dogfighting: "Dogfighting Tactics"
 dogfighting_desc: "Tactics in being able to shoot and avoid being shot at can greatly help our pilots to gain air superiority."

 squad_hunters: "Squad Hunters"
 squad_hunters_desc: "Small squads of aircraft are able to exert localized control over airspace and intercept bombers that cannot fight back. By creating greater amounts of these small squads, we can intercept bombers before they reach their intended targets."

 bomber_sweeps: "Bomber Sweeps"
 bomber_sweeps_desc: "The primary objective of fighters is to intercept enemy bombers. By sweeping an area clear of bombers, we can protect vital forces and infrastructure."

 strike_formations: "Strike Formations"
 strike_formations_desc: "Our fighter craft must be able to coordinate with other fighters to outmaneuvre and destroy the enemy. One-on-one engagements only exist in a vacuum, and teamwork is vital to reducing enemy air power."

 aces_in_wings: "Aces in Wings"
 aces_in_wings_desc: "There is no replacement for combat experience. Our pilots must be quick to learn and adapt from battlefield conditions. From there, we will be able to easily identify our best pilots from the ones who excel the most."

 aces_in_schools: "Aces in Schools"
 aces_in_schools_desc: "Rather than focusing on individual aces, we should train our pilots in advanced piloting schools to ensure a higher baseline of quality for our airforce."

 rapid_deployment: "Rapid Deployment"
 rapid_deployment_desc: "Our fighter pilots must always be ready to deploy at a moments notice to protect our airspace. Though our airmen are always ready, they are also more prone to mistakes due to fatigue and quick actions."

 dispersed_formations: "Dispersed Formations"
 dispersed_formations_desc: "By dispersing our fighter formations, we are able to cover greater areas of airspace and achieve general air superiority over vast areas."

 concentrated_formations: "Concentrated Formations"
 concentrated_formations_desc: "Concentrating our fighter formations allows us to achieve localized air superiority and use defeat in detail to extend superiority to further areas."

 fighter_escorts: "Fighter Escorts"
 fighter_escorts_desc: "Our fighters should fly in close proximity to our bombers and engage targets as they close in. This allows for greater coordination with our bomber formations and ensures that they are always protected."

 level_bombing: "Level Bombing"
 level_bombing_desc: "Tactical bombers are less accurate than dive bomber but are more safer and easier to use. Their bombs can also be used in a diverse set of roles outside of battlefield engagements making them an extremely versatile tool."

 torpedo_strike_formations: "Torpedo Strike Formations"
 torpedo_strike_formations_desc: "The concept of the torpedo is extremely useful as it targets the ship hull below the waterline where its armor is weakest. We should focus on improving torpedo-based naval bombers."

 hunting_formations: "Submarine Hunting Formations"
 hunting_formations_desc: "Special formations designed to sweep large areas in the most effective manner will lead to higher chances of detecting submarines"

 deck_strike_formations: "Deck Strike Formations"
 deck_strike_formations_desc: "Deck striking focuses on the use of dive bombers to accurately deliver their payload to enemy vessels. This has the bonus effect of being able to destroy the flight deck of enemy carriers and render them unable to deploy their own aircraft. We should focus on improving naval dive bombers."

 air_superiority: "Air Superiority"
 air_superiority_desc: "To ensure the safety of our support aircraft, total air superiority must be achieved. The first step to accomplishing this is to locate enemy fighters before they can threaten us."

 spotter_wings: "Spotter Wings"

 low_altitude_training: "Low Altitude Training"
 low_altitude_training_desc: "In order to ensure the highest level of accuracy, our strike craft must fly at extremely low altitudes to deliver their ordinance. Training our pilots to perform high risk maneuvres at these altitudes will prepare them to evade enemy fire from anti-aircraft weapons and fighters."

 low_level_bombing: "Low Level Bombing"
 low_level_bombing_desc: "Flying closer to the ground puts our bombers more at risk, but our bombs will fly truer to our aim. Destroying the target is of utmost priority."

 operational_integrity: "Operational Integrity"
 operational_integrity_desc: "Even under constant threat, our bombers must be able to maintain a cool head and perform as if they would under ideal conditions. Formations designed around the current operation will allow them to have peace of mind."

 overloaded_bombers: "Overloaded Bombers"
 overloaded_bombers_desc: "The more ordinance our bombers can fit, the more damage they can do. The limits of our aircraft must be pushed if our bombing runs are to succeed."

##Naval

 TIER_3_LABEL_NAVAL_TT: "Tier 3 covers the advanced doctrines for naval combat. For late-war fighting, these are necessary to achieve victory."
 MASS_ASSAULT_DOCTRINE_DESC: "\"Perfect\" weapons are overrated, a large number of \"good enough\" weapons is the path to victory!"
