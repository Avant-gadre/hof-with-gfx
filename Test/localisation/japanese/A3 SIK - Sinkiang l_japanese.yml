 SIK_infantry_equipment_0: "Hanyang Type 88"
 SIK_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Hanyang Type 88"
 SIK_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Originally a product of late Guangxu era 'Self Strengthening' efforts, the Type 88 was designed as a close copy of the German Gewehr 88 with export modifications. While collectively inferior to newer rifles despite improvements, and often poorly maintained, the weapon is known to be rugged and reliable if unwieldy.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Xining Arsenal in Qinghai, though equipment shortages and personal preference often see it used alongside non-standard weapons such as the Dadao."

While appearing similar, the Type 35 is shorter, has the rear of the receiver covered, and the gas-trap system replaced by a simple gas port. The new rifle is also no longer able to switch to manual action and uses magazines from the Bohemian ZH-29 rifle and ZB-26 light machine gun."

 SIK_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "As the most produced artillery during the Beiyang era, this artillery entered service in many armies across China.\n\nFollowing the Qing restoration, the new government announced that it would be renamed the 'Xuantong Type 13', but republican forces still refer to it as the 'Xinhai Type 10'."

 SIK_motorized_equipment_1_short: "Citroën P21"
 SIK_motorized_equipment_1_desc: "In November 1931, the great Croisière Jaune (Yellow Expedition) organised by Citroën arrived in Xinjiang. Yang Zengxin, the governor of Xinjiang, was surprised by the French expedition across the Silk Road, and warmly received the expedition team. Seeing that these trucks can drive continuously in harsh environments, during the expedition's stay in Xinjiang, Yang Zengxin proposed to purchase a batch of Citroën P21 cars, and the expedition readily agreed to this request because the purpose of their expedition was to advertise for Citroën. Soon after the expedition arrived in Beijing in February 1932, the French shipped the first batch of auto parts and engineers to Xinjiang. This truck has also become the most common truck in Xinjiang."
