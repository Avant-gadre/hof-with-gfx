 submarine_1_desc: "The first submersible warships actually capable of effective combat actions, these designs are significant improvements over their predecessors. With diesel-electric engines replacing the primarily petrol-electric engines of the first submarines, they have greatly improved range and surface speed compared with their predecessors. In combat with enemy warships, they act mainly as submersible light torpedo boats, but lack the submerged speed or endurance to remain underwater for more than relatively brief periods. These are the submarines that were used by the major naval powers during the Weltkrieg."
 submarine_2_desc: "The evolution of the earlier submarine designs, some of these warships took 'cruiser' submarines ideas further, with larger guns and a greater emphasis on surface abilities, while others look in the other direction, seeking to increase underwater capabilities and performance."
 submarine_3_desc: "The gains made by some earlier designs in extending underwater range, speed, and overall abilities, led to the turn in submarine development away from 'cruiser' types and back towards vessels with a greater emphasis on underwater capabilities. Vastly improved over earlier types, these submarines carry potent payloads of torpedoes and are a legitimate threat to almost all surface ships. However, they are still limited in submerged duration, range, and speed, and remain vulnerable when surfaced, especially to aircraft."
 submarine_4_desc: "With greatly increased battery capacity, advanced systems to refresh air while still submerged, and overall refined designs, these are the first submarines intended to be able to remain submerged for most of the duration of their time at sea. As such, they mark a massive shift in naval warfare, and the ascendancy of submarines to being true terrors. Such warships offer the ability to dominate the oceans to those nations that developed and deployed them."

 destroyer_1: "Weltkrieg Destroyer"

 destroyer_3: "Advanced Destroyer"
 destroyer_4: "Modern Destroyer"
 destroyer_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg brought a new demand for destroyers- not only were they required to protect their fleets, but they were also stretched thin to protect the Entente shipping lines as well. To meet this need, destroyer designs were streamlined, entering mass production to keep up with demand. Ships of this era are typically 1000 tons, and travel at a top speed of 34 knots, while carrying a larger pair of torpedoes than their forebears."
 destroyer_2_desc: "By 1935, with increasingly potent new aircraft designs entering service, as well as several navies deploying more carriers, while there was still some doubt about just how useful the carriers would be in open warfare, concern over the potential threat that aircraft might pose to warships was growing. German carrier operations during the Chinese intervention and continued British exercises had shown the world that the carrier has a purpose in the navy. As a result, destroyers saw the introduction of the dual purpose primary armament, granting a vastly improved anti-aircraft role to the destroyer, again increasing their usefulness. These ships, displacing up to 2,500 tons, often carry increased payloads of torpedoes to offset the reduced torpedo load-out on more modern cruisers."
 destroyer_3_desc: "With the start of the Second Weltkrieg the world's navies needed cheap anti-aircraft platforms. The success with carrier combat had shown the world that they are suited for more than just recon and anti-carrier duties and they are required for modern anti-capital ship warfare. Advanced anti-submarine technologies also are playing an essential role in combating the major threat to convoy operations, they and the anti-aircraft platforms intensified demands for more destroyers. While previously destroyer investments were being lowered in favour of cruisers and the new battlecruisers, destroyers begin to return to the fore as an essential part of both the fleet, and the convoy system. Often not larger than their predecessors they are far more technologically advanced, mostly adopting flush decks and far larger torpedo armaments."
 destroyer_4_desc: "Near the end of the Second Weltkrieg, the navies of the world were forced to adapt to new submarines that could stay submerged for almost indefinite periods of time, carriers which are loaded full of planes more than capable of destroying capital ships, with big gun cruisers quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of carriers and submarines. The future role of the escort for the fleet is being taken over almost solely by destroyers in the minds of most naval theorists, with dual purpose rapid firing turrets destroying any planes that dare cross her path in an attempt to dive bomb her. The displacement of these vessels was increased as well, often coming up to 3,000 tons as designers load them with more and more anti-aircraft weapons, as well as more primary guns."

 torpedo_cruiser: "Torpedo Cruiser"
 torpedo_cruiser_desc: "Based on the Jeune École ('Young School') doctrine which held that small warships armed with torpedoes could effectively and cheaply defeat much larger battleships, these cruisers are primarily armed with torpedoes. Most of the torpedo cruisers fell out of favour in most of navies in the 1890s, though many other navies continued to acquire them into the early 1900s. The modern torpedo cruisers are designed to use torpedoes that submarines cannot carry."
 light_cruiser_1_desc: "Better quality armour and the development of steam turbine engines led to the rise of light armoured cruisers. Faster and better protected than the protected cruisers, these designs came to supplant them in the 1910s. While lighter and smaller than other contemporary ships they still are true cruisers, retaining the extended radius of action and self-sufficiency to act independently across the world."
 light_cruiser_2_desc: "The interwar period saw refinements of larger cruisers that had appeared since the Dreadnought Race. With politics and finances still constraining many naval powers, the produced designs are only marginally larger in size than the previous generation, instead seeing upgrades in firepower through the use of bigger guns or the growing adoption of triple turrets and quadruple torpedo tubes. The growing importance of aviation in naval warfare also led to the adoption of high-angle dual-purpose mounts, supplemented by a growing array of autocannons."
 light_cruiser_3_desc: "Thanks to increased available funding, the new cruisers built at the end of the interwar period and the beginning of the Second Weltkrieg again slightly increased in size. While the primary armament's calibre remained unchanged once more, with few exceptions, their firepower was increased further by adding an extra turret or raising the number of guns in each turret. Secondary armaments was upgraded with further twin dual-purpose guns and even more dedicated anti-aircraft armament, often linked with improved fire controls. This generation also see the growing adoption of radar systems on cruisers."
 light_cruiser_4_desc: "The cruisers of the late-war and early post-war period remain similar to the ones of the early war, while incorporating the numerous lessons learned throughout. With aircraft confirmed to be one of the greatest threats to ships, designers focused on improving AA capabilities even further through better fire-control, improving coordination between batteries and radar. Some navies are also experimenting with autoloading mechanisms for the main armament, dramatically improving their rates of fire."

 battle_cruiser_1: "Weltkrieg Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_2: "Improved Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_3: "Advanced Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_4: "Modern Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_1_desc: "In the years immediately after Weltkrieg, the great naval powers all began design work on a new generation of ever more powerful battleships, in which battlecruisers were to play the role of 'fast battleships'. Their design is intended as an intermediate class, with the guns and range to fight older battleships on their own terms as well as the speed to chase down lighter cruisers and escape the more modern battleships they have no chance of beating themselves."
 battle_cruiser_2_desc: "After the initial wave of battlecruiser orders across the world, the design was thoroughly inspected for improvement potential. Better rangefinders were implemented, improvements in triple barrelled turret designs were made to reduce weight and improve armour, and additional space was made for more floatplanes to be added to improve the recon ability of the ship. This new generation of designs is widely adopted in different countries, where a second naval race had begun to fracture national budgets."
 battle_cruiser_3_desc: "Progress in battlecruiser design came with a revaluation of the role of these ships, and with adjustments in the trajectory of previous developments. While they retained the mediocre armour of their predecessors, these ships changed course on the path of their guns, generally moving to reduce barrel diameter in favour of gun designs with increased velocity. Most are armed with six main guns, in double or triple turrets, and most of those guns are 11-12 inches or equivalent."
 battle_cruiser_4_desc: "The evolution of the battlecruiser, by the mid-1940s, had reached its apex: ships with the speed to cruisers but the firepower to threaten true capital warships enough to keep them on their toes. While the firepower of the ships is less useful with the rise of the carrier, they found great use in shore bombardment and carrier escort duties. Functionally greatly enlarged cruisers with much heavier armour and guns, most of these ships are armed with six to nine main guns of extremely high velocity designs, allowing for the armour penetration and range to engage battleships respectably while also functioning as an effective lone convoy raider more than capable of dealing with escorting destroyers and lighter cruisers."
 battleship_1: "Weltkrieg Battleship"
 battleship_2: "Improved Battleship"
 battleship_3: "Advanced Battleship"
 battleship_4: "Modern Battleship"
 battleship_1_desc: "Designed shortly before the Weltkrieg began, and completed while it raged, these classes represent the highest level of naval development prior to the start of that conflict. They were the fleet-leading warships of the war, and remain highly potent long after it ended. While they are notably faster than the Dreadnoughts before them, their most notable differentiating feature is their escalated armament- they carry eight to ten main guns, most in twin turrets but a few in new triple turrets. Their devastating firepower and heavy armour guaranteed that they would be at the heart of their battle fleets in Weltkrieg, but those continued advances came at quickly escalating prices. Even more so than the warships before them these classes demanded huge investments, though they were only shadow of what was to come."
 battleship_2_desc: "The end of the Dreadnought Race led to large scale naval construction largely ceasing, and naval funding, which had grown to enormous levels in the period up to 1925, finally collapsing. The 'Great Powers' spent the next decade slowly finishing ships already under construction, while focusing development on smaller ships that were easier to slip through the naval budgets. It wasn't until the early '30s that the Great Powers began to experiment with fast battleship designs. These battleship designs are far more modern, with improved rangefinders, powerful oil fired engines, and 16 to 18 inch guns, but are generally iterative, focusing more on delivering a powerful ship at the best price rather than being a drastic improvement over their predecessors."
 battleship_3_desc: "With the Second Weltkrieg on the horizon and international tensions higher than ever, designers are looking to construct a new generation of ships to fight in the upcoming war. While some nations had transitioned their naval hopes to carriers, others still insist that the carrier can only provide a supplementary role, rather than replacing the primary anti-capital ship role of the battleship. These nations instead retool their newer designs, focusing on improved armour layouts and more effective guns and turrets, as well as improved speeds."
 battleship_4_desc: "At the close of the Second Weltkrieg, the Great Powers started to understand: naval air power had proved victorious over all gun capital ships. However, several nations persist with the development of Battleships, as shore bombardment platforms, prestige projects and support for carriers within the fleet or even try to promote their old role. Some designers load their battleships with anti-aircraft batteries to increase the chances of survival. Although many of these battleships may continue to operate for many years, they are already viewed as obsolete by some nations."

 carrier_4: "Modern Carrier"
 carrier_1_desc: "Having learned from the experience of using seaplane tenders, those navies with the resources to do so began work on the next generation of ships that could carry aircraft at sea. Unlike their predecessors, these carriers are designed with flight decks to allow for aircraft to both fly off of them and to then return and land on them. Converted from civilian ships and seaplane tenders, most of these ships are limited by having relatively cramped flight decks and hangars, but they definitely demonstrate that ships are capable of effectively operating air complements at sea."
 carrier_2_desc: "Developed in the '30s, these ships are designed to provide aerial reconnaissance and light fighter coverage for fleets primarily focused on more 'conventional' warship forces. Their range is significantly increased, and efforts were made to make them fast enough to keep up with fleets operating at full speed in open oceans."
 carrier_3_desc: "As major naval combat operations in the naval aviation age demonstrated the power of aircraft to seriously affect battles at sea, many powers found themselves having fallen behind in the development of their carrier forces. While fleet carriers are quickly shown to be the most potent of their kin, they are also massive ships that require a long time and large amount of resources to construct. In the rush to increase their ability to project air power into the oceans, the naval powers turned to designs like these, enlarged versions of the existing lighter carriers, to try to quickly bolster their naval aviation capacity."
 carrier_4_desc: "Continued development of carrier design led to much larger models, these ships are approaching the size of the first fleet carriers, while incorporating all of the design improvements made in the intervening years. Most have significant armour protection and withering AA firepower, while also being highly mechanically reliable. However, they abandoned concept of large calibre secondary armament in exchange for smaller dual purpose guns."

 SH_battleship_1_desc: "As the Dreadnought Race reached its height, these true monsters were conceived. Far greater in size and firepower than anything that came before, their cost is staggering, and few nations can afford to even consider constructing them. Nonetheless, those that do find themselves in possession of truly mighty weapons of naval supremacy. Even more so than the generation before them, dreadnoughts suffering from the conditions of their conception. Rushed design work, last minute and improvised redesigns during construction, shortages of the huge amount of resources they required, immense pressure to rush construction, and the sheer size and complexity of their massive mechanisms, all led to design flaws and vulnerabilities beneath their vast armoured hides. These designs are armed with twelve to fifteen 18 inch or equivalent main guns."
 SH_battleship_2_desc: "Once the afterglow of the great Dreadnought Race had faded away, naval designers took stock of the position of dreadnoughts in future planning. Discarding speed as a major goal, with the understanding that the new generation of so-called 'fast battleships' would assume that task, these designs instead focus on extreme, unprecedented, armour protection. Advanced 16 inch guns could equal the armour penetration of 18 inches, while being less expensive."
 ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc: "The rapid increase of resources devoted to naval construction after the end of major land conflict during the Weltkrieg initially produced these designs, which featured the beginnings of the trends towards sudden growth in size, firepower, armour, calibre and of course, cost. Such vessels set the world's leading naval powers apart from the mere pretenders to greatness, but they have their issues; their rapid development and rushed construction led to design flaws and persistent mechanical problems. These designs are armed with eight to ten 18 inch or equivalent main guns, and have the protection to go toe-to-toe with similarly armed ships. As the Dreadnought Race reached its height, these true monsters were conceived. Far greater in size and firepower than anything that came before, their cost is staggering, and few nations can afford to even consider constructing them."

In first attempts to do so, German engineers made almost impossible and succeeded in mating almost-battleship-level armament with a cruiser hull. The result is a ship that outguns any other known cruiser, but which is also expensive, comparatively slow and relatively poorly armoured.
