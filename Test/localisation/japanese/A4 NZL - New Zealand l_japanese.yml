 NZL_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk III"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_0_short: "SMLE Mk III"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The \"Owen\" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming."
 NZL_night_vision: "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 NZL_night_vision_short: "Tabby Scope"
 NZL_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 NZL_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 NZL_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 NZL_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 NZL_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 NZL_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 NZL_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 NZL_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 NZL_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 NZL_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 NZL_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 NZL_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 NZL_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 NZL_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 NZL_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 NZL_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
