 SPR_las_plagas_DESC: "Las Plagas is an ancient parasitic creature that lies dormant deep underground somewhere in Spain. The first Illuminati master, Adam Sadler, unearthed it and enshrined it as an object of faith in an attempt to control all of humanity through it to achieve the ultimate goal of permanent peace. After too many setbacks, now the fifteenth Patriarch Osmond found an opportunity in the Spanish Civil War, and the anarchists, desperate for power, did not hesitate to accept the gift of Las Plagas... So the Church of Light finally got what it wanted to control all of Spain, and their next goal was naturally to continue the dream of the first Patriarch's bubble."
