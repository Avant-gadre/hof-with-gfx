 RHI_Valkist_weak_opening_idea_desc: "The so-called \"passive resistance\" has been going on throughout the history of the Rhineland Occupation, which [GER.GetName] officially neither denies nor admits, and which has been allowed to be fomented by the \"folk\" of all sorts, while paying fixed reparations. It is obviously the fault of the Germans, and while delivering the fixed reparations have been indulging various \"folk\" in fanning the flames in the Rhineland.\n Whether or not the [FRA.GetName] Occupation authorities have made even greater mistakes, the [RHI.GetName] has now begun the process of reform, and by appointing the Rhinelanders to self-government, and by its usual iron fist, it has been able to suppress for the time being an increasingly \"unresponsive\" resistance."
 fate_rhine.1.t: "The Legacy of the Occupation of the Ruhr"
 fate_rhine.1.d: "In 1923, in order to counteract the bargaining of Populist Germany over reparations, [FRA.GetName] and [BEL.GetName] simply joined forces to occupy the Ruhr industrial zone as \"punishment\", creating the \" Ruhr Crisis\" after a series of negotiations and compromise and endless quarrels and more bloodshed, in Marie Antoinette's insistence, the French army finally just withdrew from the east bank of the Rhine, and then set up in the west bank of the \"military trusteeship\", the trusteeship date lasts until Versailles reparations are paid off. The date of the trusteeship lasted until the reparations for Versailles had been settled. \nObviously the occupation of the Ruhr was not resolved but put on hold, and now [FRA.GetName]'s behavior is widely regarded as more military than anything else, and the official Franco-German border on the Rhine seems to have ensured France's future national security, but [GER.GetName]'s attitude towards the reparations has been even worse since then, and the [FRA.GetName] is also in the \"Military Trust Territory\". GetName] also practiced economic plunder in the \"military trust territories\" to compensate for the losses of the Great War in northern France, and as a result, there was a great deal of violence. It was not until the onset of the Great Depression that the Parisian authorities were forced to decentralize the administration and grant autonomy to the locals, and with the necessary financial support, the Franco-Cooperativist mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, with his fiercely anti-populist and Rhenish-nationalist policies based on Catholicism, began to alleviate the sharp Franco-German tensions in the region. In order for the current favorable situation to continue, [RHI.GetName] must now do all it can to avoid another crisis."
 fate_rhine.1.a: "But it's not like it's up to us, the puppets, to decide whether a crisis is a crisis or not!"
 fate_rhine.2.t: "Industrial revival"
 fate_rhine.2.d: "The birth of [RHI.GetName] was based entirely on the military perspective of [FRA.GetName], and thus thanks to the \"support\" of the Parisian side's longstanding policy of looting, the level of development of the West Bank Rhineland is now in shambles, and even though a lot of factory equipment was moved from the East Bank Rhineland, the level of development of the West Bank Rhineland is now in shambles, and even though a lot of factory equipment was moved from the East Bank Rhineland, the level of development of the West Bank Rhineland is now in shambles. Even though a lot of factory equipment was moved from the East Bank Rheinland, many machines have been abandoned and rusted under the chaotic management situation formed after the many conflicts. \nThese ridiculous things until the last few years began to slowly improve, the occupation forces from the east coast of the continuation of the violent repression behavior with the Adenauer's policy of appeasement less and less, the destruction caused by the previous economic plundering is gradually turning into a business opportunity, thanks to the Rhineland's popular business culture for a long time, many of the German people who are not interested in the populism is ready to seize the opportunity, the authorities are happy to use this to revitalize the Rhineland industry."
 fate_rhine.2.a: "Tax exemption!"
 fate_rhine.3.t: "[FRA.GetName] Market collapse!"
 fate_rhine.3.d: "The worldwide economic depression is over, but that doesn't mean that a series of secondary economic crises won't occur one after the other, Marie Antoinette's regime's prolonged hike in military spending has left France's economy on shaky ground, and even after dragging it through the depression it hasn't lasted past the present. \n For other neighboring countries this crisis may not be a big deal, however for us who rely heavily on France's financial aid can be a bit..."

 fate_rhine.5.d: "There is no doubt that Queen Marie... Oh is that ex-queen... Or was it ex-ex-queen? Anyway it doesn't matter, as the single-handed creator of [RHI.GetName]..."
 fate_rhine.5.a: "We thank her for her service and congratulate the new government."
 fate_rhine.6.t: "[RHI.GetName] asked for financial support to be restored"
 fate_rhine.6.d: "It's clear that the [RHI.GetName] authorities don't have any independent solution in the face of the current crisis, and if we don't provide support, the series of political violence triggered by the economic crisis will only get worse, and perhaps have a rather troubling and pernicious effect in the future."
 fate_rhine.6.a: "Paris is still responsible."
 fate_rhine.6.b: "Why don't they try the miraculous shock therapy we're using?"
 fate_rhine.6.c: "Be that as it may, given the financial situation..."
 fate_rhine.7.t: "[FRA.GetName] Restore financial support"
 fate_rhine.7.d: "Thanks to the interventionist policies being practiced on the part of Paris, we have also regained financial aid, which will at least alleviate immediate needs."
 fate_rhine.7.a: "That's good."
 fate_rhine.8.t: "[FRA.GetName] Unheard"
 fate_rhine.8.d1: "Thanks to the liberal policies being pursued on the part of Paris, we are being asked to ignore the economic crisis and wait for its natural recovery."
 fate_rhine.8.d2: "The Parisian side made a clear statement of refusal, claiming that the subsidies would not be restored until the French economy improved."
 fate_rhine.8.a: "This is bad."
 fate_rhine.9.t: "Dealing with civil unrest."
 fate_rhine.9.d: "Would the Rheinlanders like a military trusteeship? Obviously not! So the anger-filled people may have listened to the slanderous words of the populist infiltrators and pushed for a direct end to the military occupation by taking to the streets at this [FRA.GetName] perceived moment of greatest weakness. \nIn the absence of Mr. Adenauer, the [RHI.GetName]authorities must be extremely careful at every step, and the intelligence and police services should actively work with their collaborators to strictly screen purely Antifa elements from the general angry public. \n Of course, it's not impossible to strike hard with a direct line 1923 story, it's just that doing so in the absence of strength could be extremely risky, and even [RHI.GetName] would cease to exist."
 fate_rhine.9.a: "Let the fellows execute the carrot and stick policy with precision."
 fate_rhine.9.b: "Directly contact the French army to send out FT-17s to send them to the sky!"
 fate_rhine.10.t: "Rheinland Free Corps"
 fate_rhine.10.d: "According to information from the Second Office of the General Staff in Paris, the Rheinland Populist Organization has been led since 1923 by Karl-Leo Schlageter, a prominent member of the Free Legion, a man who has caused enough trouble for us in the Rhineland to get him shot ten times. If we can gather the relevant information he must be arrested or killed at the first opportunity, if we lose this mainstay the Rheinland Populist Movement will surely suffer a heavy blow. \n addition, according to Director Dion's assessment report, Schlageter's longstanding activities have given him a tendency to sanctify himself among a wide range of supporters, and his popularity spans both sides of the Rhine, which might lead to an even more unfavorable situation if he were to be killed."
 fate_rhine.10.a: "Catch a few more minions who go around fanning the flames before dealing with the man himself!"
 fate_rhine.11.t: "German anti-populism"
 fate_rhine.11.d: "A Rhineland ruled directly from Paris would not work after all, the Rhinelanders resented the way they had been treated in previous years, and if they wanted to remain on their feet, the only path was to continue expanding Rhineland autonomy. \n addition to Adenauer there are many collaborators waiting to be discovered, the authorities are time to let go and vigorously promote [GER.GetName] dissident groups, make good use of the many anti-populist groups, preferably in the future to support a rival German government and the Berlin authorities, so that the German anti-populist ideological barriers are far more solid than simply the French Army Rhineland military region."
 fate_rhine.11.a: "Is it too late?"
 fate_rhine.12.t: "The Great Unrest is over."
 fate_rhine.12.d: "It is fortunate to have gotten this far, as the Rheinland Occupation Authorities have gradually taken control of the chaotic mess with a careful gesture in the absence of key collaborators. \n Looks like it's time to fulfill the promise, the Occupation Command's sign has been taken down, the Cologne Municipality has been officially elevated to the Rheinland Government, and a regime with an anti-populist tone has been formally established."
 fate_rhine.12.a: "It is time to rebel against Prussian tyranny."
 fate_rhine.12.b: "Fight back to Berlin to save Germany!"
 fate_rhine.13.t: "Rotten mess."
 fate_rhine.13.d: "One wrong step is a lost cause, the Rhineland Occupation Authorities have nearly collapsed under a growing wave of protests, and things have come to a point of no return. Karl-Leo Schlageter made a public appearance leading his men in an attack on the occupation forces, and as they were about to disarm an armored company surrounded by an angry population, General Charlemagne's troops suddenly drove from the Alsatian border into the Rhineland, quickly dispersing the populace and routing the Freikorps after an inevitably brief and bloody clash. \n Though however, it is claimed that he did not get the go-ahead from Paris."
 fate_rhine.13.a: "Looks like it's saved... Wait you are going to?"

Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent. Capable of carrying eight soldiers in addition to towing a gun or a trailer, the truck became the main vehicle of panzergrenadiers."

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

Initially developed in 1932 as 6 wheels variants, it was obvious that this variant will be obsolete in the nearest future. In 1937 the 8 wheels variant armed with 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon was introduced in service. The all-wheel drive four-axle Sd.Kfz. 231 are one of the most technically advanced armoured vehicles and are able to operate on rough terrain, with a cross-country comparable to that of tanks."

The main version of the vehicle, also known as Sd.Kfz.234/1, is armed with open-top turret fitted with a 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon and coaxial M.G. 34."

 RHI_armored_car_at_equipment_short: "Sd.Kfz. 234/2"
 RHI_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "A respectable armoured car, the Sd.Kfz.234/2 (also known as 'Puma') presents great speed and a significant 50 mm KwK.39/1 cannon. With improved frontal armour and formidable main gun, the car can traverse into volatile areas that are generally restricted to other like-minded vehicles. Being the greatly improved variant of the Sd.Kfz.234, the 'Puma' is intended to be used in a 6-strong platoon as a support vehicle. More often, though, commanders use the Sd.Kfz. 234/2 as fast tank hunters."
 RHI_artillery_equipment_1: "10,5-cm leichte Feldhaubitze Modell 33"
 RHI_artillery_equipment_1_short: "10,5-cm le.F.H. 33"
 RHI_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 RHI_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 RHI_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 RHI_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 RHI_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 RHI_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 RHI_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."
 RHI_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 RHI_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 RHI_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 RHI_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 RHI_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 RHI_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 RHI_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 RHI_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 RHI_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."
 RHI_anti_air_equipment_1: "2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 RHI_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 RHI_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 RHI_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 RHI_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 RHI_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 RHI_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 RHI_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 RHI_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."
 RHI_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "28/32-cm Schweres Wurfgerät Modell 40"
 RHI_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_short: "s.W.G. 40"
 RHI_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed for Nebeltruppen (Smoke Troops) for smokescreen setting, the schwere Wurfgerät 40 exists in two variants - with wooden and steel frames. The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."
 RHI_rocket_artillery_equipment_2: "21-cm Raketenwerfer Modell 42"
 RHI_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_short: "R.W. 42"
 RHI_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."
