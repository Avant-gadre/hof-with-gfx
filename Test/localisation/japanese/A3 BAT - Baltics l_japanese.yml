 BAT_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "The Sonderkraftfahrzeug 11 was developed from 1934 to 1938 and involved Borgward AG and, from 1937 onwards, the design became associated with Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG. Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent. Capable of carrying eight soldiers in addition to towing a gun or a trailer, the truck became the main vehicle of panzergrenadiers."

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

 BAT_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 BAT_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 BAT_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 BAT_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 BAT_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 BAT_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 BAT_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_1: "2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."
 BAT_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "28/32-cm Schweres Wurfgerät Modell 40"
 BAT_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_short: "s.W.G. 40"
 BAT_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed for Nebeltruppen (Smoke Troops) for smokescreen setting, the schwere Wurfgerät 40 exists in two variants - with wooden and steel frames. The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."
 BAT_rocket_artillery_equipment_2: "21-cm Raketenwerfer Modell 42"
 BAT_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_short: "R.W. 42"
 BAT_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."
