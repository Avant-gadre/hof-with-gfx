 BUL_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "When the Avia company's B-34 design was passed over by the Dual Monarchy, the company looked to the export market to recuperate its investment. Lacking any modern biplanes, Bulgaria adopted the B.34 in 1934."
 BUL_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 BUL_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 BUL_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Like the B-34, this model was also adopted by the Bulgarians, and unlike its predecessor, the B-534 was also adopted by the Dual Monarchy."

 BUL_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire. The DAR company acquired the right to produce the craft within Bulgaria due to its impressive performance in Habsburg service. Slight modifications were made by the DAR company, but the craft remains essentially the same."

The fighter was accepted into Bulgarian service as the DAR-12."
