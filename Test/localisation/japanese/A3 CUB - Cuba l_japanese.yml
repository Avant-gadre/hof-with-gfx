 CUB_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Model 1903 was developed at Springfield Arsenal when, following the Spanish-American war, the United States deemed the Krag-Jørgensen rifle inadequate on account of its weak action; at its core, the 1903 was an attempt to combine beneficial features of both the Krag and captured Spanish Mausers. The rifle was gradually adopted along with the .30-06 cartridge both before and while the rest of the world waged the Weltkrieg."

 CUB_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "While Hungarian arms designer Pál Király's heavy submachine guns were adopted by the Dual Monarchy, they nonetheless fell short of Király's own expectations. The Cristóbal is a development of those SMGs redesigned around a new intermediate calibre cartride. While it was ultimately rejected by the Dual Monarchy, the Dominican Republic, where Király had once considered immigrating, proved more receptive, adopting the gun as the 'Cristóbal' Carbine after the city of San Cristóbal. Cuba licensed production soon after its Dominican introduction."
