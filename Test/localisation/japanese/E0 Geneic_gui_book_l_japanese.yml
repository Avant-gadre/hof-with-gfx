 GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "As 1936 dawns, the Great War's legacy lies heavy upon the shoulders of a new generation.In Germany and Dutch, the Valkism is consolidating its power and its attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's old borders. Nero's Roman Empire continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to China and Western Imperialism in Asia. While in Russia, the conflict between the White and the Red is continuing. Seventeen years have passed since the end of the war, and few expect the new year to bring a turning point, The Versailles system looks impregnable from Europe to America, but soon a single spark may be all it takes to light the powder keg anew..."

 GATHERING_STORM_NAME: "Gathering Storm"
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "British politics lies in a careful balance between the king-centric Knights of the Round Table and the parliamentary clock tower. Although the prestige of King Arthur I cannot be underestimated, the clock tower still has a strong political and economic influence in Britain. A Welsh-born king restricted England's dominance over the country and thus eased domestic separatist tendencies. The powerful HMS defended the British Isles and overseas colonies. \nHowever, this smooth climate of governance meets the challenge of extremism in continental Europe. And British colonies overseas are also facing nationalism challenges worldwide. The King's character is known for his rectitude. How long can the stability of British politics remain in this situation?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The French Royal Family, which regained power, was in a state of flux. The suspension of the throne led to the absence of a head of state, the fragmentation of domestic political forces and the disorder of the people. The Dragon Witch is engaged in destructive activities in Orleans; Germany and Italy are in irritablity. France, in the midst of internal and external troubles, urgently needs a leader to lead them to the future of the French people and to face their own destiny."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The effort of Roman revivalists had paid off: the ancient empire has now risen again. But the reform on the politics could not solve the problem of weakness of the previous Italy in economy and military. The Emperor Nero was regarded as a tyrant and the enemy of Christians. On the other time, the tension between the Empeeror and Senatus is constantly increasing, which make the country even more unstable. \n\n However the Emperor has met her new friends: Fascists. The chance of a thorough renewal is quite appealling. How will this ancient and new empire choice her path?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "As the first Asian country that make its modernization, Japan stands at the crossroad of Asia and Europe. The wheel of expansion and invasion has begun to roll, but the domestic situation is not so promising: extremists are always threating the democratic but corrupt government, and new factions of political power inside the bureaucrats are also rising. At the same time, the government is in fierce confict with the military. \n Japanese diplomacy is swinging between imperialism, which requires Japan to expand its territory and realm, and pan-asianism, which imagines Japan as the liberator of the Asia from western colonists. The choice of Japanese is related to the fate of the whole Asia."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "As the biggest victim of the Treaty of Versailles, the German state has not set off the retro movement of royal politics in other European powers. It has always adhered to the restrictions and peace imposed by the Treaty of Versailles ... before everything can be used. \n\n The Hohenzollern family, a symbol of the old order, has long been firmly controlled by the radical Dutch nationalists. The Valkist Germany can no longer be shaken. 'Germany will prevail!'. And the hero just looked at them and said nothing. Maybe he also had his own plans?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The October Revolution delivered Lenin's version of socialism to Russia with a bang, and within a few years the red flag was planted over half of the once immense but impoverished empire. Observers did not anticipate that this revolution would expand so quickly, just as they did not anticipate that it would be stubbornly stopped west of Siberia by the White Army. \n\nThe lack of industrialization gradually sapped the nascent revolutionary regime of its own energy, a regime that had to face both internal and external enemies, and the almost unattainable task of industrialization. It had to make a choice, even if the cost was quite heavy..."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1919, when Hungary withstood joint armed intervention from its arch-rival Romania and two nascent states, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, prompted the Allies to abandon all claims for reparations against the country and hastily demarcate the post-war borders roughly along the cease-fire lines of the time. \n\n Being the only member of the Central Powers that did not sign the Versailles Peace Treaty, Hungary possessed a far stronger nationalism than the average traditional state, and Bathory, the national hero who led the 1919 war to victory, took this opportunity to remain in the position of regent. Of course, the war never really ended, and the next time the Dacians crossed the Carpathian was just around the corner."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Romania entered the World War as if on speculation and was swiftly defeated by the Central Powers, only to recover its territory and continue its territorial claims from the war after the collapse of the Central Powers in 1918, pulling together the fledgling nations of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia to attack a lone Hungary should not have been as difficult as it was in 1916. \n\nAnother failure completely brought the foreign royal family to the bottom of its reputation, and the angry Dacians elected their own king after driving them out of the country. In view of the repeated betrayals by the Mazars this king vowed to complete his revenge, and the emergence of the ultra-nationalist group of the Angelic Presidency Mikhail's Legion soon gained his favor with its position of protecting the king, and the next battle of Karpatan, which gathered the strength of the whole nation, is about to be prepared."
 RUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Anastasia, meaning \"resurrection\" in Russian. The \"rebirth\" of the Tsar marked the resurgence of the \"White Army Movement\" as a counter-revolutionary movement. The White forces, which had been fighting separately, miraculously came together and opened a defense line in Siberia. Thus began a protracted war that lasted nearly twenty years. \n\nHowever, the Tsar's position was not secure, the republican forces within the White Army were still strong, and the internal suspicion of the forcibly pinched together rabble was still full of suspicion. The outlawed Omsk Provisional Government is in exile abroad, and the tensions within the White Army may mean opportunities for them as well."
 UKR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Ukraine, the breadbasket of the Russian Empire, became the front line of engagement between the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary in the last Great War. In the civil war, Ukraine chose to cooperate with the Germans, but the disintegration of Germany cost them. Now, as part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine bore the cost of industrialization. The failed collectivization campaign has led to famine in the Ukraine, and perhaps, angry Ukrainians will choose to change their existence by force again..."
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "As a neutral country, Sweden has fortunately escaped the last war, but the impact of the war on international trade has seriously affected the Swedish economy. The rise of Nazism in Germany raised the Nordic myth to an unprecedented position, and the rise of racism led the Nordic to be worshipped among racists as an idealized Germanic image. \n\n Sweden has taken advantage of the technological advantages of peacetime. Despite its weak military strength, it has an industrial potential that cannot be underestimated and ample iron ore reserves. People can't help but ask, will Sweden remain neutral in the upcoming conflict?"
 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "In Mesopotamia, the birthplace of world civilization, there are various ethnities from almost everywhere. In the last war, Britain exchanged a great uprising against the Ottoman Empire with the locals on the condition of establishing a complete independent country. However, the betrayal of Westminster secretly divided up the Middle East with France, leaving only Mesopotamia as an independent country. \n The rise of Gilgamesh may bring new hope to this country. Faced with invaders that are gradually showing their teeth in Europe and Asia, the people of Mesopotamia are ready to defend their own home. At the same time, a black liquid flowing underneath quietly changed their destiny..."
 SPA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "With the death of the Marquis Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1930, the situation in the Kingdom of Spain was rapidly spiralling out of control and the monarchy itself was becoming very unpopular as a result of the defeat in the Rif War. In 1931, with French help, the army defeated an attempted coup d'état that sought to overthrow the Kingdom and establish a republic. In 1931, with the help of the French, the army defeated a failed coup attempt to overthrow the kingdom and establish a republic, but under growing political pressure, King Alfonso XIII reconvened the parliament and restored democracy, appointing a government dominated by conservatives. Instead of peace and reconciliation, strikes, military coups, political assassinations and riots ensued. Although it survived these challenges, Spanish society was still torn by political polarisation and violence between the anarchists, communists, republicans, churches and the Phalangists. \n\nThey all pinned their hopes on the upcoming 1936 elections, but whichever side emerged victorious seemed unable to bring stability to the country. As the violence continues, the army has begun to stir, waiting to strike......"
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer $GER_siegfried_sigmund$ makes no secret of his desire for more \"living space\" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 FIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "A pearl of the French colonial empire, Indochina is the most profitable French colony. Intended mainly for economic exploitation through its many raw materials, the French presence is relatively weak. The administration primarily relies on support from the indigenous elites, supported by the famous Indochinese riflemen.The French presence has constantly been challenged,and the economic devastation caused by the Great Depression could very well lead to a new wave of protest and uprising."
 MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Mexico stands at the closing days of the Maximato, the period when the Quadruple Alliance held thr power in Mexico using right wing loyalists in both politics and the military. Since 1933, Cristero ,Zapata  and other warlords have waged a political war to end the Quadruple Alliance's control over the country. Mexico stands at a crossroads while the world prepares for war, as the left wing and right wing battle over control of the country's future and where it stands in the coming new world order."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "It has been almost 20 years since Czechia gained independence from the Austro-Hungarian empire and the small country now counts amongst some of the most industrialized countries in the world.Valkism rise to power in Germany has emboldened the German-speaking minority in the border regions and put the small country under international pressure. France, the traditional ally of Czechia, is in internal political turmoil, and as the diplomatic power of the Little Entente is slowly fading, Europe is changing."
 EGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Kingdom of Egypt remains in a standstill. Almost 15 years have passed since the unilateral declaration of independence from the British Empire, yet latter is still utterly determined to keep the country as a permanent military base in order to safeguard their global empire. The ever more belligerent [ITA.GetName] to the west only reinforces this idea.\n\nEgypt's main aim has always been to gain full independence and establish itself as the dominant power in the region. Perhaps now is the time to embrace desired dreams once and for all?"
 BEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Belgium may seem like an insignificant territory between France and Germany, but it's a densely industrialized country extracting precious resources from Congo .The government is recovering from the Great Depression and lost colonial war with congo, infrastructure projects are in full swing, and industrial activity is slowly recovering. On the political scene, many voters seek solutions in extremist discourses. Rexist gains popularity day by day and may threaten the traditional coalitions of democratic parties. Meanwhile, the Flemish nationalists are also active, spreading dissent among the military's lower ranks."
 RHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "After the Ending of the Great War the once biggest industrial Centre of the former German Empire found itself under the control of the victorious Entente Powers. Whether it will be part of the New Reich again or choose its own Path is a question only time can answer."
