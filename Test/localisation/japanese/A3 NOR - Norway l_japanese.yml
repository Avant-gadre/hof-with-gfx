 NOR_get_rid_of_quisling_desc: "Quisling's coup was never meant to last. It was a stopgap in case our fascist allies needed someone to give the invasion a semblance of legitimacy. Now that it's clear we won't be needing this overconfident buffoon, we must discard him as soon as possible."
 NOR_elevate_hirden: "Elevate Hirden"
 NOR_elevate_hirden_desc: "Hirden has served us well as the paramilitary branch of the Nasjonal Samling, but as we find ourselves with a burgeoning fascist regime, we should consider solidifying its position in the [NOR.GetAdjective] government's power structure."

 NOR_extensive_recruitment_desc: "If we wish to expand our empire, we must scour the [NOR.GetAdjective] lands in search for soldiers with the spirit of their Norse ancestors.

 NOR_invite_german_engineers: "Invite Fascist Engineers"
 NOR_invite_german_engineers_desc: "[NOR.GetName] has never been an industrial powerhouse, our predecessors focused more on trading than producing our own products.

 NOR_the_crowns_executive_powers_desc: "As the king continues to reject any calls for him to wield absolute power, we have no choice but to grant him executive powers. When he wakes up from his political slumber, he will have the tools to guide [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] towards glory!"

So we can produce the aluminum needed despite not having any large deposits of bauxite."
 NOR_haerens_flyvevaaben: "Hærens Flyvevaaben"
 NOR_haerens_flyvevaaben_desc: "The new frontier of warfare is in the skies. If we let the enemy have total control over our airspace, our ground forces will not be able to act effectively. We must develop an air force that can act in favor of our ground troops."
 NOR_norwegian_planes: "Norwegian Planes "
 NOR_norwegian_planes_desc: "We have witnessed that today's allies could be tomorrow's invaders, for this reason we cannot rely on foreign powers for our planes, their importance in the modern battle field is to great."

 NOR_anti_air_artillery_research: "Anti-Air Artillery Research"
 NOR_anti_air_artillery_research_desc: "As new technologies are deployed in the air above, the weapons that allow us to defend our airspace from the ground must match them so we don't succumb to the enemy's air supremacy."
 NOR_anti_air_construction: "Anti-Air Construction"
 NOR_anti_air_construction_desc: "Our rugged terrain makes [NOR.GetName] a difficult target for enemy invasion, but our skies are exposed to enemy aircraft, which makes them an advantage for a potential foreign invasion. We must build the necessary anti-air batteries to prevent this."
 NOR_invest_in_airfields: "Invest in Airfields "
 NOR_invest_in_airfields_desc: "No point in having planes if we don't have the infrastructure needed to launch them. We are sorely lacking in the required infrastructure to meet the demands of an expanding air force."

 NOR_buy_aa_from_sweden: "Buy AA from Sweden "
 NOR_buy_aa_from_sweden_desc: "Our neighbor to the East, [SWE.GetName], has for a long time excelled in manufacturing Anti-Air guns, far beyond anything we can make. We could approach them with a request for buying these Bofors guns to defend our skies during the imminent invasion."
 NOR_luftforsvaret_desc: "It is time for our Air Force to stop being a mere support arm for our land armies, and evolve into its own branch of the armed forces. One that has the resources necessary to conduct all the operations required for modern combat in an effective manner."
 NOR_radar_research: "Radar Research"
 NOR_radar_research_desc: "As a country with a vast coastline it is vital that we can monitor it effectively. Thanks to the technological miracle that is Radar, we can be aware of incoming ships and planes from longer distances."
 NOR_repurpose_lighthouses: "Repurpose Lighthouses"
 NOR_repurpose_lighthouses_desc: "Weather and geology have made lighthouses all across the [ROOT.GetAdjective] coast a requirement, and event an icon of our nation. We can transform them into beacons of hope by using them to support Radar equipment and help us fend off invaders."
 NOR_pilot_training: "Pilot Training "
 NOR_pilot_training_desc: "Even though our incipient air force is small and under developed, we can pull from our tradition of aviators and explorers to inspire the new generation of [NOR.GetAdjective] pilots, who will deliver us our continued independence."
 NOR_the_royal_norwegian_navy_desc: "Having one of the longest coastlines in the world has its advantages, but it also means that extra effort must be expended defending it. Our navy will be the first lines of our nation's defense. "
 NOR_expand_the_dockyards: "Expand the Dockyards"
 NOR_expand_the_dockyards_desc: "Despite having one of the biggest merchant marines in the world, our dockyard capacity could certainly be expanded, and optimized for a better output of military ships, instead of simply producing cargo vessels and tankers."
 NOR_battleship_focus: "Battleship Focus "
 NOR_battleship_focus_desc: "Only gargantuan, armored hulks can guarantee that we truly rule the waves. The threat of seeing one of our battleships on their coast, will deter any potential invader."

 NOR_convert_merchant_ships: "Convert Merchant Ships"
 NOR_convert_merchant_ships_desc: "Our merchant marine is the pride of our economy, but it will not do us any good if invaders destroy our lands. Our shipping magnates will have to make a sacrifice for [ROOT.GetName] and let us make these vessels combat worthy."
 NOR_expand_merchant_marine: "Expand Merchant Marine"
 NOR_expand_merchant_marine_desc: "Modern warfare needs resources and equipment, two things that [ROOT.GetName] is desperately lacking.

Yes, we already have more civilian ships than most nations, but we expect to lose many of them along the way, and we can't afford to be cut short."
 NOR_expand_naval_academy: "Expand Naval Academy"

 NOR_convoy_bombing: "Convoy Bombing"
 NOR_convoy_bombing_desc: "The smaller the merchant fleet of the enemy, the more impactful our massive fleet can be. If we undermine their shipping, we can turn the tide of the war."
 NOR_rebuild_the_royal_navy: "Rebuild the Royal Navy"
 NOR_rebuild_the_royal_navy_desc: "We're far away from our country, so to reach it again it will probably be by sea. Rebuilding the Royal Navy is tantamount of rebuilding our nation."
 NOR_pan_germanic_entent: "Pan-Germanic Entente"
 NOR_emergency_conversions: "Convert Merchant Ships"
 NOR_emergency_conversions_desc: "We have a massive merchant marine, but they sail at great risk to themselves through dangerous seas. We should strip a number of these smaller vessels, lightly arm them and have them protect our vulnerable shipping. We can always refit them later for more specialised duties should we need it."
