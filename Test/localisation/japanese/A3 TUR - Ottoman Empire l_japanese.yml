 TUR_the_montreux_convention: "The Montreux Convention"
 TUR_the_montreux_convention_desc: "It is outrageous that despite everything that has happened since the Great War, we are still denied the rights to administer our own straits. Instead of a unilateral seizing of the straits by our military, let us instead try a more deft diplomatic maneuver so we can escape this crisis without becoming Europe's new pariah."
 TUR_the_montreux_convention_tt: "We shall call a §YConvention§! announcing our intention to remilitarize the §YDardanelles§! and the §YBosporus Strait§!. We should be prepared for potential backlash from the §YSoviet Union§!."
 TUR_fully_integrate_the_is_bank: "Fully Integrate the İş Bank"
 TUR_fully_integrate_the_is_bank_desc: "Celâl Bayar and a group of likeminded liberals and advocates for democracy have bound themselves to the institution of the İş Bank, which Atatürk established in 1924. By integrating the İş Bank and the liberals chained to it, we can signal to our nation and to the wider world that Turkey is finally ready to take the next few tentative steps towards becoming a full-fledged democracy."
 TUR_sanayiciler_liberals_tt: "\nThe §YSanayiciler Industrial Projects§! decisions will be cheaper on account of our liberal economic model."
 TUR_ratify_the_six_arrows: "Ratify the Six Arrows"
 TUR_ratify_the_six_arrows_desc: "The Six Arrows symbolize the six fundamental pillars of Kemalism and our ratification of these principles into Turkey's national constitution will surely do a great deal to aid us in our mission of entrenching Kemalist values across all of Turkey."
 TUR_privatize_the_anadolu_agency: "Privatize the Anadolu Agency"
 TUR_privatize_the_anadolu_agency_desc: "Freedom of the press is a necessity under a true democracy, and though we may not love a free media we will just have to learn to cope with them. We can take a big step in this direction by privatizing the state-run Anadolu Agency, which has spread the news throughout Turkey since Atatürk founded it in 1920."
 TUR_privatize_the_anadolu_agency_tt: "Removes the §YInstitute Press Censorship§! decision."

 TUR_lift_the_ban_on_other_political_parties_desc: "Without fail, every single time a new political party has been established to contest the CHP it has invariably been hijacked by religious fundamentalists who would pervert our republic and its founding principles for their own means. This time things must be different - and yet we must remain vigilant all the same."
 TUR_holding_our_first_multi_party_election: "Hold Our First Multi-Party Election"
 TUR_holding_our_first_multi_party_election_desc: "The very fate of the Republic of Turkey hangs in the balance based upon the upcoming election: but we swore to fight it fair, and fight fair we have. The Turkish people can be trusted to make the right call."

 TUR_DEMOCRATIC_TRANSITION_FOCUS_DESCRIPTION_STANDARD: "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk long dreamed that [ROOT.GetNameDef] would one day become a fully functioning democracy, and it would appear that we have successfully fulfilled that dream."
 TUR_DEMOCRATIC_TRANSITION_FOCUS_DESCRIPTION_ISLAMIST: "Adnan Menderes, by pushing transparently Islamist policies on a platform of democratic rights, has become the Man of the Nation. [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] is undergoing a conservative revolution, and all the world can do is watch in dismay."
 TUR_expanding_our_armaments: "Expand Our Armaments"
 TUR_expanding_our_armaments_desc: "The world is changing, and we will bear a responsibility to take up arms against those that would threaten not only the Republic of Turkey but the ideological foundations upon which it stands. It should take very little to convince the sanayiciler of this, and to secure their aid in protecting our country."
 TUR_permit_regional_elections: "Permit Regional Elections"
 TUR_permit_regional_elections_desc: "Turkey is a large country of many religions, cultures, and interests - perhaps it would not be flexing the boundaries of the constitution too badly if we were to allow a certain degree of autonomy across the nation, even to those that have rallied hardest against Kemalism... all in the name of national security, of course."

 TUR_privatize_our_infrastructure: "Privatize Our Infrastructure"
 TUR_privatize_our_infrastructure_desc: "As staunch liberals, we should learn to depend more on private enterprise rather than letting the state intercede in every single matter of construction.

 TUR_democratic_capstone_focus_desc: "[Root.GetDemocraticCapstoneFocusDesc]"
 TUR_DEMOCRATIC_CAPSTONE_FOCUS_DESCRIPTION_STANDARD: "Being a responsible democratic power comes with more responsibilities than just guaranteeing your own citizens freedoms. The world is dangerous, and democracies across the world are under assault by sinister forces. We have a duty to stand up for freedom."
 TUR_DEMOCRATIC_CAPSTONE_FOCUS_DESCRIPTION_ISLAMIST: "We cannot effectively govern until we have flushed the Kemalist scum out of every organ of the state. We cannot even trust our own armed forces to be loyal to the rightfully elected government! That needs to change."
 TUR_civil_war_tt: "§RPurging the Kemalists from our armed forces will start a civil war. The strength of our starting position will depend upon how strong the Islamists are in the midlands, and whether we have reformed our armed forces or not. Kurdistan will break away and fight for its freedom if stability is below 60% when this focus is completed.§!"
 TUR_the_sanayiciler: "The Sanayiciler"
 TUR_the_sanayiciler_desc: "Atatürk has worked tirelessly over the years to cultivate a class of entrepreneurs and industrialists to assist in the modernization of our state.

 TUR_sanayiciler_tt: "Using §YPolitical Power§! and other means at our disposal, we will be able to empower our burgeoning industrial class to invest their resources into erecting §YCivilian Factories§! and §YMilitary Factories§! for the state's use.\n"
 TUR_cooperate_with_the_debt_council: "Cooperate with the Debt Council"
 TUR_cooperate_with_the_debt_council_desc: "When the dust settled after the Great War, the Republic of Turkey remained standing: a free and independent nation. Well, except for the fact that [TUR.GetNameDef] has inherited the obscene debt that the Ottoman Empire racked up, and the fact that same debt is managed overseas by our would-have-been conquerers. It is not ideal, but we can work together and invent a scenario that benefits us all."
 TUR_debt_council_nationalized_tt: "The §YDebt Council§! will no longer maintain control over the debt of §Y[TUR.GetNameDef]§!."
 TUR_utilize_foreign_capital: "Utilize Foreign Capital"
 TUR_utilize_foreign_capital_desc: "Our nation is young and much of our land is bare of industry, but we do not have to work alone on this matter. A strong Turkey is in the interests of many of the European powers, and if we go to them for aid then they shall surely give it."
 TUR_foreign_capital_tt: "The higher our relations with the old §YGreat Powers of Europe§! and the §YUSA§!, the more options for §Yinvestment§! we will be able to pay for."
 TUR_treaty_of_saadabad: "Treaty of Saadabad"
 TUR_treaty_of_saadabad_desc: "We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by remaining friendly with our neighbors to the east. The idea of a treaty formalizing our friendship has been lobbed around on occasion, and it is high time for Turkey to take the initiative and make sure this friendship is codified in a treaty."
 TUR_assess_our_future: "Assess Our Future"
 TUR_assess_our_future_desc: "When Mustafa Kemal Atatürk liberated this nation and declared its independence, he did so with a very specific vision of what the [ROOT.GetAdjective] state should eventually look like. The time has come to analyze whether the vision of our Ghazi still aligns with the priorities of the current administration."
 TUR_choices_will_decide_legacy_tt: "§YMustafa Kemal Atatürk§! has long championed §Y[ROOT.GetNameDef]§!'s transition from an authoritarian one-party state into a multi-party liberal democracy.

 TUR_ataturk_seeking_treatment: "Atatürk seeking medical treatment"
 TUR_the_hatay_issue: "The Hatay Issue"
 TUR_the_hatay_issue_desc: "We can no longer sit idly by and allow the oppression of Turkish minorities by Arab irredentists and French imperialists. The notion that Hatay is not every bit a rightful part of Turkey is ridiculous and to be dismissed out-of-hand as revisionism. It is time to set right the mistakes of 1921."
 TUR_peace_in_the_world: "Peace in the World"
 TUR_peace_in_the_world_desc: "Atatürk once proclaimed Peace in the World as the ultimate aim of Turkish foreign policy, and we intend to live up to that lofty goal. We work towards peace on Earth, not eternal war over petty land squabbles."
 TUR_continue_the_policy_of_etatism: "Continue the Policy of Etatism"
 TUR_continue_the_policy_of_etatism_desc: "İsmet İnönü and a group of fellow left-wing ministers are in favor of pivoting our economic policy away from laissez-faire liberalism and towards a uniquely Turkish state-managed economy. Etatism, like Kemalism, represents the perfect fusion of left-wing and right-wing ideologies into something even greater which serves the Turkish people best."
 TUR_sanayiciler_etatism_tt: "\nThe §YSanayiciler Industrial Projects§! decisions will be more expensive on account of our Etatist economic model."
 TUR_peace_at_home: "Peace at Home"
 TUR_peace_at_home_desc: "Our potential enemies will pounce upon us the moment they sense weakness inside of us.

 TUR_turkish_state_railways: "Turkish State Railways"
 TUR_turkish_state_railways_desc: "Without the intervention of the state, our country will permanently remain a disparate nation of rich and urban cities in the west and decentralized tribes in the east. By connecting our nation together with infrastructure, we bring the entirety of Turkey into the twentieth century, not just our wealthy coastal cities bordering the Aegean."
 TUR_revive_turkish_revolutionism: "Revive Turkish Revolutionism"
 TUR_revive_turkish_revolutionism_desc: "The reformation of the Turkish political system has clearly proved inadequete in the face of widespread opposition by the Turkish people. But is the solution to appease the masses, or to double down on the radicalism of our reforms? Kemalism has changed at the core level before: who is to say where the next reconfiguration of its ideological components will take it in the future?"
 TUR_reinvigorate_turkish_nationalism: "Reinvigorate Turkish Nationalism"
 TUR_reinvigorate_turkish_nationalism_desc: "The only way to unify the country is mimic the rule of Mussolini. We need a strong right-wing leader that is not opposed to left-wing economic reforms and who can speak to the heart of the people. There is only one man for the job: the esteemed Marshal Fevzi Çakmak."
 TUR_the_second_five_year_plan: "The Second Five Year Plan"
 TUR_the_second_five_year_plan_desc: "The first Five Year Plan was a great success, so the best government ministers in the country came together and decided that if the first Five Year Plan was such a success, then why not have another?"
 TUR_the_guardians_of_kemalism: "The Guardians of Kemalism"
 TUR_the_guardians_of_kemalism_desc: "The Kemalist officer corps can only do so much when it comes to the dissemination of Kemalist ideals throughout the nation. It is time for the government to take a more proactive approach in helping Kemalism win the hearts and minds of the Turkish population."
 TUR_kemalist_state_targets_tt: "Two unaligned states become §YKemalist§!\n"
 TUR_the_sun_language_theory: "The Sun Language Theory"
 TUR_the_sun_language_theory_desc: "The Sun Language Theory is the theory that all human languages are descended from the same Turkic root language.

 TUR_TURKISH_VARIANT_TAX_FOCUS_DESCRIPTION_SECULAR: "Religious institutions have had it far too good in this country for far too long. Time and time again, religious authorities have sought to undermine this government and its efforts, so now we shall liberate them of their wealth so that it can be put to better use."
 TUR_turk_ulusu: "Türk Ulusu"
 TUR_turk_ulusu_desc: "Part of being a responsible and modern country is being able to redefine what it means to be a citizen of said country. We have been too strict on what it means to be Turkish, and to properly represent the make-up of our country it is high time we expand the definition of what makes a citizen a Turk."
 TUR_loosen_the_laws_on_secularism: "Loosen the Laws on Secularism"
 TUR_loosen_the_laws_on_secularism_desc: "Religion has been the single greatest dividing factor for our nation: we have committed to a path of secularism, but why? To mimic the weak nations of the west? It is not the business of the state to decide when, where, and how a man prays to his god."
 TUR_purify_the_diyanet: "Purify the Diyanet"
 TUR_purify_the_diyanet_desc: "The Diyanet has been stacked with men who have never prayed to the Almighty even once in their empty, hollow lives. The Diyanet should be filled with men of faith: men who service themselves to the state and turn to Allah for guidance and comfort!"
 TUR_kemalist_officers_made_hostile_tt: "§RThe Kemalist Officers will strongly take issue with the government's course of action.§!"
 TUR_rehabilitate_the_kadro_movement: "Rehabilitate the Kadro Movement"
 TUR_rehabilitate_the_kadro_movement_desc: "It was a mistake to shut down Kadro and disperse its theorists. They approached the state with fresh and revolutionary ideas and we turned our backs on them. A new kind of nation requires new ideas, and there are no bolder ideas found outside of Kadro!"
 TUR_kemalism_and_the_modern_movement: "Kemalism and the Modern Movement"
 TUR_kemalism_and_the_modern_movement_desc: "When Recep Peker returned from Italy with a report on how fascism could be made compatible with Kemalism, he was ejected from his office. Fascism is the creed of the twentieth century, and we were fools to look past the ideology best suited for Turkey when it was staring at us from right across the Adriatic!"
 TUR_kemalism_and_the_modern_movement_tt: "All the §Yfascist§! countries in §YEurope§! will have their opinions of [ROOT.GetNameDef] increased by §G+25§!."

 TUR_restack_the_officer_corps_desc: "The officer corps uphold the key values of Turkey, but those key values have... changed. If the officers are reluctant to reflect the current values of Kemalist ideology, then we shall force them to embody those values."
 TUR_restack_the_officer_corps_tt: "The §YKemalist Officers§! shall be reorganized to be more amenable to the government's wishes. \n§RIf the country is below 50% stability and the Kemalist Officers have been greatly empowered then they can be expected to revolt against the government!§!"
 TUR_form_the_redshirts: "Form the Redshirts"
 TUR_form_the_redshirts_desc: "Every legitimate fascist movement across the world has a shirted movement! The English and Italians have blackshirts, the Germans have brownshirts, the Chinese have blueshirts - the color red best reflects the Republic of Turkey, so we shall form the redshirts! When people hear the term 'redshirt', they will instantly think of the men and women supporting our movement! We are geniuses!"
 TUR_fatherland_first: "Fatherland First!"
 TUR_fatherland_first_desc: "There are a lot of elements of Turkish society that would undermine the government and destabilize our society for their own selfish reasons. That stops with us: from now on, every citizen of Turkey will put their Fatherland First!"

 TUR_deal_for_the_oniki_islands: "Deal for the Oniki Islands"
 TUR_deal_for_the_oniki_islands_desc: "The Oniki Islands off our coast were ripped from our hands and passed off to the lecherous Italians, but not before the perfidious Greeks put their claim to the islands. Rhodes was Turkish, and Rhodes will be Turkish again!"
 TUR_the_pontic_redoubt: "The Pontic Redoubt"
 TUR_the_pontic_redoubt_desc: "We have doted on our western defenses for far too long while ignoring our border with the openly irredentist [SOV.GetNameDef]! We cannot hope to hold them at our border alone for long, but by fortifying a redoubt along our river lines we can hope to best them in a war of attrition. What other hope do we have?"

 TUR_abuse_the_office_of_soil_products_desc: "The Toprak Mahsulleri Ofisi was founded to regulate the production of foodstuffs and the wages of agricultural workers, but [ROOT.GetNameDef] does not need farmers - it needs land. We shall pressure the poorly performing farm owners into selling their land so that new industry can be erected on those plots to the benefit of the nation as a whole."
 TUR_kemalist_socialist_theory: "Kemalist Socialist Theory"
 TUR_kemalist_socialist_theory_desc: "The Kadro Movement stands for a fundamentally patriotic form of socialism, and is very akin to the British strain of fascism and Marxism-Leninism in many ways. In essence, Kadro puts the Turkish worker first on a fundamental level, and does not seek to sweep away their national identity while doing so. Ours is a truly revolutionary movement, and more importantly: it is a truly Turkish movement."
 TUR_patriotism_over_internationalism: "Patriotism Over Internationalism"
 TUR_patriotism_over_internationalism_desc: "We reject the internationalism of Trotskyism and radical Marxism in favor of a truly national form of socialism. The plight of the international worker is secondary to the struggles of the Turkish laborer, and that is what sets Kemalist-socialism apart from the more radical variants of communism."
 TUR_create_the_turkish_workers_militia: "Create the Turkish Workers' Militia"
 TUR_create_the_turkish_workers_militia_desc: "Politics is a dirty business, and no regime is guaranteed permanence.

 TUR_halk_ve_devlet: "Halk ve Devlet"

 TUR_nationalise_all_private_industry: "Nationalize All Private Industry"
 TUR_nationalise_all_private_industry_desc: "We do not disregard the contributions of industrialists and liberals in our mutual fight to protect the Turkish state from predatory foreign powers, but they have gotten too big for their own britches. While protecting us from predatory venture capitalists, they have become the predatory venture capitalists. It can be abided no longer: we must nationalize our industry and protect our workers."
 TUR_georgian_manganese_extraction: "Manganese Extraction in Georgia"
 TUR_georgian_manganese_extraction_desc: "There are many minerals and metals remaining unutilized inside of Georgia, and all while our own steel stockpiles remain disappointingly low. We shall send an offer to the regional Georgian administration, and barter for our rights to extract their metals for them in exchange for keeping some of the excesses for ourselves. Should they agree, we shall manufacture the steel right next to the operation in Trabzon."
 TUR_salt_the_scars_of_the_great_war: "Salt the Scars of the Great War"
 TUR_salt_the_scars_of_the_great_war_desc: "The Turkish people have grown soft in the years since the War of Independence. Where is the rage that we need so badly if we are to project our might onto the world? We lost so much in the Great War, more than most, and the only reason we survived was because we fought tooth and claw for that right to survive. We will fight tooth and claw in the next war too."
 TUR_intervene_in_the_spanish_civil_war: "Intervene in the Spanish Civil War"
 TUR_intervene_in_the_spanish_civil_war_desc: "The Spanish Civil War has turned into the world's petri dish for competing ideologies. We share the Mediterranean, and that gives us more right than most to choose to intercede on behalf of our chosen side in the war."
 TUR_a_common_destiny_for_all_of_turkey: "A Common Destiny for All of Turkey"
 TUR_a_common_destiny_for_all_of_turkey_desc: "Turk, Greek, Kurd, Christian, Muslim, Atheist - we are all in this together. It is in our collective interest to come together as a whole and unite behind a strong government that backs radical ideas and works for the collective as a whole. We shall stand united, or we shall perish divided."
 TUR_hunt_down_fifth_columnist_islamists: "Hunt Down the Fifth Columnist Islamists"
 TUR_hunt_down_fifth_columnist_islamists_desc: "While Europe frets over their internationalist communist fifth columnists, we have been struggling with our own internationalist fifth columnists since the very birth of our nation. There exists no greater existential threat to our grand republic than radical Islam and its antiquated proponents. We shall squash these dregs of the Ottoman Empire like the insects they are."
 TUR_pivot_to_the_past: "Pivot to the Past"
 TUR_pivot_to_the_past_desc: "The War of Independence may have been a necessity, but the Republic was a mistake.

We shall oblige them, after putting down the Kemalists once and for all."
 TUR_purge_the_kemalists: "Purge the Kemalists"
 TUR_purge_the_kemalists_desc: "By ridding our country of the Kemalist scourge, we will have sown the seeds for the return to our old ways of living and of governing. The Sultan's return is inevitable, as is the destruction of the ephemeral republicans."

 TUR_restore_the_divan_desc: "A parliament of civil stooges elected by our enemies? No, we never intended for that to last for very long. It is time to bring back the old ways: we shall restore the Divan so that religion sits at the very center of the state.
