As soon as the all-clear was given, jubilant crowds rushed onto the streets to celebrate their American liberators, while church bells could be heard ringing throughout the city.\n\nLiberation fever seems to be embracing Britain, as it now finally appears likely that the German occupation is coming to an end.

Much of the city lies in ruins after previous battles, and local resistance members hurriedly emerged from the rubble to greet their liberators.\n\nWith Warsaw under Soviet control, the strategic situation for Germany in Eastern Europe may soon deteriorate further.
