 news.114.d: "Today the last resistance movement in Paris has been extinguished and the city is now firmly controlled by the Italian army. \n\n [ITA.GetLeader] hurriedly flew to the victory parade on the Champs-Elysées. He rode a white horse to the front of the parade. At the celebration, [ITA.GetLeader] compared the current victory with Caesar's conquest of Gaul, and promised that this was only the beginning of the great rise of Rome. \n\n Time will tell if what he said is correct."


 news.203.t: "Poland cedes Poznan"
 news.203.d: "With the ultimatum of [GER.GetAdjective] submitted to [From.GetNameDef], [From.GetLeader] and [From.GetAdjective] the government decided to meet all requirements to avoid war. \n\n They hope that the loss of Poznan will save [From.GetNameDef] from Germany's larger territorial ambitions. However, the situation remains tense, and it is said that Polish border guards were not given an order for contact alert."
 news.204.d: "Considering this requirement, everything seems inevitable. \n\n [From.GetNameDef] will have to cede Poznan to Germany and send a plenipotentiary to Germany to discuss other matters. [From.GetLeader], in a statement on [GER.GetNameDef]'s recent move, stated that it was clear that Germany would not be satisfied with the small Poznan. \n\n The German and Polish armies are preparing for war, and reports of border conflicts are coming in large numbers. The war in Europe is reignited."

 news.23.d: "Diplomats from [ITA.GetNameDef] have delivered an ultimatum to [ALB.GetNameDef], demanding the latter's annexation into Roman Empire. \n\nIn a brave act of communist leadership, Enver Hoxha has refused to yield to the Italian demands, urging the Albanian people to resist pressure from [ITA.GetNameDef]. "The Albanian people are not afraid of anyone. The tyrant in Rome and the monopolistic bourgeoisie around her can never destroy the revolutionary fruits of the Albanian people! We will fight every inch of our land. We will make Albania a fortress for the people. We are going to completely smash the imperialists' wolf ambitions!" \n\nNevertheless, foreign military experts agree that [ALB.GetNameDef] has little chance of resisting an invasion."
