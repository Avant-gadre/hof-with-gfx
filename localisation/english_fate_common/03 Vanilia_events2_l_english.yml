 MTG_naval_treaty.9.desc: "Delegations from Britain, France, Italy, Japan and the US met in December of 1935 to discuss a renewal of the First London Naval treaty, which restricted the number and size of cruisers and submarines. Negotiations turned quite heated over Italy's war in Ethiopia and Japan's desire to be seen as equal to Britain and the US.\n\nWith negotiations now at an end, the signatory nations have agreed on limits to the size of battleships and aircraft carriers in the hopes of preventing another ruinous arms race."
 MTG_naval_treaty.9.a: "This will safeguard peace better than any Super-Battleship!"
 MTG_naval_treaty.9.b: "Why would they restrict themselves like this?"

 mexico.1.title: "General Cedillo Revolts"
 mexico.1.desc: "For some time, the generals and governors have seen their personal power dissipate as the central government becomes better at keeping the unruly caudillos in check. Mexico's history of rebellions by regional warlords seemed to be dying out. Unfortunately, we failed to act against General Cedillo of San Luis Potosi, and he has retained the services of enough pardoned rebels and ruthless bandits to try to overthrow the central government, depose [Root.GetLeader], and prevent any more power slipping through his fingers."

 mexico.12.title: "Sale of British Honduras"
 mexico.12.desc: "[From.GetLeader] has requested that [Root.GetNameDef] sell the small territory of British Honduras, sometimes called Belize. The Spanish empire claimed the region but never settled it, so Mexico has little real claim to the territory. However, we could sell the territory to our Mexican friends as a gesture of good faith."

 mexico.15.title: "Archbishop Pascual Díaz Passes Away"
 mexico.15.desc: "The Most Reverend Pascual Díaz y Barreto, Archbishop of Mexico City, has passed away today due to colitis. He was 59. His legacy is one of hardline opposition to the socialist policies of the government, together with attempts at compromise towards the end of the Cristero War.\n\nHis successor is Luis María Martínez, a social reformer and personal friend of President Cárdenas. The successor was probably selected by the Pope to ensure continued peace between Church and government in Mexico."

 mexico.16.title: "Oil Worker Strike"
 mexico.16.desc: "The oil workers unionized in 1935 with the blessing of President Cárdenas, creating the Sindicato Único de Trabajadores Petroleros. They immediately began trying to negotiate higher wages and better working conditions, but were rebuffed by the powerful international oil firms like Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil of California. The matter passed to an arbitration committee and eventually went to the courts, with the burning question being whether the oil firms could afford the higher wages.\n\nAccording to recent investigations, the Mexican subsidiaries make even more profit than oil companies in the United States, but still refuse to come to an agreement with the workers. It seems they have the backing of powerful regional strongmen and see themselves as being above the law."

 mexico.16.b: "That's capitalism."
 mexico.18.title: "Election Campaign Begins"
 mexico.18.desc: "The election campaign for the next President is due to begin in the next few days. The 1933 constitutional reform was introduced in response to anger at the idea of Calles becoming president for a second term, and after the outright assassination of Calles' predecessor, Álvaro Obregón, who sought such a second term. This reform prevents an elected official serving twice, even if he was only an interim or provisional caretaker. This helps prevent a repeat of the Porfiriato, which saw dictator Porfirio Díaz serve seven terms in a thirty year period and inspired the 1910 Mexican Revolution, plunging the country into a decade of civil strife.\n\nThis law has the benefit of making patronage networks outside the party more difficult to sustain, but also prevents officials being directly accountable to electors, as they will move to a different tier of government after their term, making them reliant on patronage within the party."
 mexico.18.a: "This constitutional reform is essential for the stability of the country."

 mexico.20.title: "Juan Andreu Denounces Election"
 mexico.20.desc: "Right-wing businessman and Revolutionary general Juan Andreu Almazán has denounced the outcome of the recent election. He claims his support was greater and that [Root.GetLeader] only won thanks to manipulating the outcome. While this might be true, Juan Andreu is certainly acting like a sore loser. He has gone into self-imposed exile in America and is trying to organize a coup attempt against the [Root.GetRulingPartyLong]. Remaining on good terms with America would be prudent."
 mexico.20.a: "Go on, run to the Yanquis."
 mexico.22.title: "Lev Trotsky Returns to USSR"
 mexico.22.desc: "After growing anti-Stalinist sentiments in the Soviet Union, the ruling clique of that country has decided to recall Trotsky from exile and place him as their figurehead at the top of the government.

Our submarine captains have taken to calling these 'the Happy Times'. There are many tantalizing targets to choose from, such as neutral Mexican oil tankers. Our admirals request permission to engage these tankers, although the foreign office warns it could have negative consequences on relations with Mexico."

 mexico.24.desc: "The Mexican oil tankers 'Potrero del Llano' and 'Faja de Oro' have been sent to the bottom of the Caribbean by German wolfpacks operating under the doctrine of 'unrestricted submarine warfare'. This attack on neutral vessels is an act of war. We would be within our rights to attack German vessels we encounter at sea.\n\nWe should also consider joining the American faction who are fighting the Germans. This would put the Yanquis in our debt and show the world that Mexico is an international player."

 mexico.26.title: "Mexico Joins the [From.GetFactionName]"
 mexico.26.desc: "[From.GetLeader] has welcomed the Mexican President's offer of support in the war against Germany. German wolfpacks recently sank the neutral Mexican oil tankers 'Potrero del Llano' and 'Faja de Oro', an act of war resulting in the loss of civilian life, and the Mexican government has stated its desire to see German u-boat activity in the Caribbean ended once and for all.\n\nThe Mexican government has sought greater recognition from the world powers for some time, and they believe that lending support to America and the [From.GetFactionName] will prove they are an international player."
 mexico.26.a: "Mexico is well within her rights to go to war for this."
 mexico.26.b: "Does Mexico even have an army?"
 mexico.26.c: "An attack on neutral shipping is a grave crime according to the laws of war."
 mexico.27.title: "Firmissimam Constantiam"
 mexico.27.desc: "Pope Pius XI has issued a Papal Encyclical addressing the Mexican situation. While the Cristiada was resolved at the negotiating table and the open bloodshed has been ended, the Church is still worried about the direction Mexico is heading in.\n\nThe Encyclical urges Mexican voters to side with religious candidates in elections, and calls for Mexican religious parties such as Catholic Action to address social problems, such as poverty, to prevent more revolutionary violence."
 mexico.27.a: "It is good that the anti-Church violence has ended."

With the government renewing its attacks on the Church, the embattled Catholic parties and social movements are launching an armed rebellion to seize control of Mexico. Cristero militias are reforming after a decade of inactivity, supplemented by defectors from the federal military. They have taken over several rural states and are using these as a base from which to operate.\n\nThe first Cristiada ended with a settlement negotiated between senior Revolutionary and Church officials thanks to intermediation by the American government, but it looks likely that this violence will end only with the complete destruction of one of the belligerents."

We must put down this attack on the Body of Christ, or the work we have done to keep alive and increase the flame of piety will come to an end and twenty centuries of knowledge of the laws of Our Redeemer and King will be forgotten."

They have launched a right-wing coup with the support of conservative monarchists and the clergy. A significant portion of the military has sided with these Nationalists, but so far they have failed to capture any of Spain's major cities with the exception of Sevilla.\n\nLeftist volunteers are meanwhile flocking to the banners of the Republican government, ready to support it against the rebels. These loyalists may be poorly trained, but no one can question their enthusiasm.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"

The outcome is still uncertain, with the world watching with concern which side will emerge victorious.\n\nWe did not execute this coup by standing idly by, however, and neither should the world if it wants to crush the red threat. Other nations in the same process of restoring their national glory should be willing to come to our aid."

 spain.2.b: "Spain must be won with Spanish blood!"
 spain.3.d: "Reactionary and fascist forces in the military have sought to crush the Republic in one swift blow, but did not expect the resistance they met in major cities nor the rapid mobilization of workers' militias. Rather than a coup, they have started a war, war on progress and the future the Spanish people wanted.\n\nDemocratic and socialist nations alike voice support for the Republic, but few dare commit to direct involvement. We could ask them to support our endeavor, or the oppressors will come for their liberty and solidarity next."

The Republicans and their allies, a mix of democrats, communists and anarchists, have turned to us and other parts of the international community for help.

Whichever coalition falls apart, their opponents are likely to take advantage of their internal conflicts to launch a revolution. This election is not the final test Spain will have to endure to resolve this conflict."

 spain.10.d: "After the peaceful election of General Francisco Franco as president of Spain, there was hope that recent years violent uprisings and political turmoil would be put to an end. Rumors that Franco would attempt to create a one-party dictatorship with himself as chief of state has been fueled by the sudden disappearances of several opposition leaders.\nAfter a swift trial, Carabineros officer José Galánfor was convicted of treason and his public execution followed shortly after. Though it was meant as a move to stamp out any will to resist the rise of Nationalist Spain it had the opposite effect. Leftist volunteers and even a group of generals have flocked to the banners of the newly formed People's Army, ready to support the fight against the oppressive Nationalists. Though most are poorly trained, they have managed to capture several key cities in the chaos that ensued the uprising.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"

While investigations are still ongoing, the available evidence very strongly suggests sabotage by an elite enemy unit.\n\nIt appears that the commandos parachuted into the area, infiltrated the plant by exploiting the shockingly lax security, placed explosives near the storage tanks and then withdrew into the night mere minutes before the charges exploded.\n\nNo civilian casualties have been reported, leading the commander to speculate that local resistance might have had previous knowledge of the raid. The local garrison is now conducting a sweep of the area, but no leads have been found, and we expect the team to have evacuated the area already."

Intelligence estimates of the number of Nationalist sympathizers have grown to alarming size. Of particular concern are reports that some Nationalist leaders are openly discussing an armed insurrection. Just yesterday, a naval vessel intercepted a suspicious fishing boat south of Java. Found on board were weapons and ammunition without official markings. Interrogation of the crew has yielded no results so far, but it appears that someone is trying to stir up trouble."
 tfv_australia.95.a: "Deeply unsettling."
 tfv_australia.96.t: "Civil War!"
 tfv_australia.96.desc: "Armed Nationalists take to the streets all over Indonesia. Military and police actions against the uprising have proven unsuccessful thus far. This armed insurrection has come in the wake of a sudden rise in Nationalist sentiment, which now means we are in an all out civil war."

 tfv_canada.10.d: "Following its abandonment of the Commonwealth, [From.GetNameDef] is negotiating for a position as one of our allies in the [Root.GetFactionName]. Their Communist convictions are strong, and it's undeniable that an ally on the American continent would be of great benefit to the cause of the world revolution...\nWhile their concept of Patriotic Socialism, independent nature, and [From.GetLeader]'s attempted Industrialization Miracle may all cause issues in the future, this seems too good of an opportunity to pass up."

 tfv_canada.12.d: "Fearing for the effect it will have on \"global stability,\" [From.GetLeader] publicly rejected our request for membership in the [From.GetFactionName].\nSeeing as [From.GetNameDef] is not above the petty politicking of the old world, our revolutionary efforts would have been wasted on them either way.\n\nEven if [Root.GetNameDef] stands alone in a world of fascism, we will not give up until true socialism has been brought to every worker in all the lands of our globe!"

 tfv_canada.22.d: "Unable to even glance beyond their own minuscule borders, [From.GetLeader]'s [From.GetName] has declined our offer of an alliance.\nOf course, with the likely collapse of the [From.GetAdjective] state and all of Europe under the weight of its own peoples, we might be better off without them."

It seems as though our government may no longer be able to keep their right-wing politics at bay, as clashes between Synarchists and government supporters have been reported across [Root.GetNameDef]. This includes the employment of lethal weapons on both sides.\nWhile it is unclear when and how the militarization of the Synarchist party occurred, they pose a real and immediate threat to the current government.\n\nCivil war is at hand."

Our old enemy, [USA.GetNameDef], dominates the continent, and have proven unable to keep themselves out of matters beyond their borders.\nThat makes the offer of cooperation with [From.GetNameDef] ever more valuable. Either of our countries might lack the force to prevent [USA.GetAdjective] intervention on our own, but against both north and south, [USA.GetLeader] will have to think twice before taking action.\n\nAnd perhaps they will be more amenable to the return of rightfully [Root.GetAdjective] territory..."

 tfv_canada.41.d: "The [MEX.GetAdjective] government is in full accord regarding the threat posed to our countries by the aggressive policies of our southern neighbors. The only way we can survive is to break the stranglehold they have on the continent. We must strike soon, before they can finish rearming. Certain territorial concessions will have to be made to our new friends, of course, but together, we will bring an end to the American hegemony!"

 tfv_canada.50.d: "An explosion rocked one of our factories today, and while it initially seemed to be an industrial accident, investigation has revealed that explosives were intentionally placed along the production lines.\nWhile we mourn the loss of life, an attack on the war effort cannot be ignored.\n\nWhoever was behind this attack poses a threat to all of [Root.GetNameDef]!"

 tfv_canada.51.a: "The larger their circle, the easier they will be to track down."
 tfv_canada.52.t: "The Quebec Circle"
 tfv_canada.52.d: "Law enforcement has been working with military police to make great strides in the case of continued factory sabotage. With the targeting of yet another factory, it has become apparent that the sabotage is not done by foreign spies, but rather by a group protesting the forced conscription introduced in Quebec!\n\nRegardless of their political concerns, our country is at war, and they are traitors of the highest degree."

 tfv_canada.53.t: "The End of the Line"
 tfv_canada.53.d: "A trap had been laid for the Quebec Circle in the factory considered to be their most likely next target for sabotage. In the dead of night, law enforcement awaited the infiltrators.\nAs the saboteurs arrived, they turned out to be a much larger group than expected, and more heavily armed, with stolen army equipment. A firefight broke out, damaging as many production lines as the Quebec Circle's plans would have.\nHowever, after the fierce fighting, not a single saboteur was left alive. The Quebec Circle has come to an end."

 canada_vanilla.1.desc: "Around a million Canadian women entered the workforce during the Second World War. They were represented in the national media by a symbol of resilience and patriotism: Veronica Foster, popularly known as Ronnie, the Bren Gun Girl. She worked for John Inglis and Company at a Toronto gun factory while her three brothers fought overseas. The posters and short movies featuring her, and women like her, participating in the war effort likely inspired the better-known media campaign around 'Rosie the Riveter', after America's entry into the war."

 mtg_netherlands.61.a: "War it is, then."

 mtg_netherlands.63.t: "Gold Reserves Evacuated"
 mtg_netherlands.63.d: "Before our capitulation, when it was clear the fight was lost, we successfully carried out our plan to evacuate our gold reserves to our new allies. The gold, having been kept aboard ships and ready to sail at any time, have now safely arrived in our host country, and should aid our government-in-exile immensely."
 mtg_netherlands.63.a: "Fortunate that we had the foresight to prepare for this."

 czech.22.t: "The Sudeten question"
 czech.22.d: "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has offered up the Sudetenland as a step towards coming to a mutual understanding. On one hand, this is a great opportunity to acquire a rich state for little cost and with little danger.

 czech.23.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer. [From.GetAdjective] troops have moved into the Sudetenland to the cheers of the local population."
 czech.23.a: "They can ask no more, surely."
 czech.24.d: "[From.GetLeader] has refused our offer to hand over the Sudetenland. He did not give any reason for this move, but the [From.GetAdjective] decision has sent a shockwave through the military, who believes the Germans might have bigger plans for us."

 czech.32.t: "Czech-Hungarian Rapprochement"

However, as German power grows, [From.GetNameDef] feels increasingly threatened from that direction. unwilling to face a threat on two sides, [From.GetLeader] now seeks to come to an understanding with us. \n\nOur government is split on the issue. One faction believes that an agreement with [From.GetNameDef] is the first step to breaking the encirclement, while the other faction points to the fact that this would no doubt draw the wrath of [GER.GetLeader]."
 czech.33.d: "[From.GetLeader] was surprisingly open to our offer. We have signed a Treaty of Mutual Friendship, affirming that neither of us has any territorial claims on the other."
 czech.33.a: "Better than expected!"
