At the same time, Yezhov said that the murder of Dzhugashvili by the traitors had made it even more clear that the need and urgency of the purge, the enemy was still strong and the Soviet Union was still in a precarious situation. Therefore, he will work with the NKVD to carry out a more thorough purge to completely eliminate the space for traitors to survive. \n\nThe seemingly sensational purge will not die out with the death of Dzhugashvili; the political struggle in the Soviet Union is about to enter a more brutal phase."

Recently, Soviet Marshal Tukhachevsky, a war hero of the Russian Civil War, publicly refused to recognize Yezhov's position as general secretary and launched a mutiny in Moscow. Tukhachevsky's army is valiant and has taken control of many of the capital's major urban areas. Some military personnel loyal to Yezhov and some internal affairs units attached to the NKVD engaged in heavy fighting with Tukhachevsky's troops, with gunfire echoing thickly over Moscow and citizens hiding in fear in their homes while waiting for the fighting to die down. \n\n Some Soviet officers expressed their approval of Tukhachevsky's mutiny and saw it as the fastest way to end the Great Purge and get the Soviet Union back on track. They had begun to respond to Tukhachevsky by helping him hold off other armies and take control of Moscow. The Soviet capital was gradually falling into the hands of the heady Chief of General Staff, and it looked like he was inching toward victory. \n Whatever the outcome, the mutiny, which took place at the heart of the Soviet Union, made the future of the Soviet Union even more uncertain. Everything is still unknown as to what way this soldier of White Russian aristocratic origin will choose to guide the Soviet Union."

He was Trotsky, who was known as the "father of the Red Army". Invited by Tukhachevsky, he returned to the Soviet Union in secret. \n\nAfter a brief exchange of pleasantries, Tukhachevsky invited Trotsky to become the General Secretary of the Soviet Union. He was well aware that he was not a professional politician and that his old aristocratic origins were not enough to convince the people. He believed that Trotsky represented the Marx and Bolshevism in his heart, and therefore made special arrangements to welcome Trotsky back from exile. Now that "Comrade Lenin's close comrade" had returned, would he be able to lead his long-lost homeland?

Today, the dust has finally settled. Tukhachevsky has established a military government. \n\nTukhachevsky told the outside world that the military government was established to "restore order in the Soviet Union, to prevent the Soviet Union from falling into civil strife again" and to "mobilize forces together to defeat the White bandits". Moscow and Leningrad were under martial law, other major Soviet cities were under military control, and despite Tukhachevsky's public promises that the junta was a last resort to stabilize the situation, some officials formerly belonging to the Dzhugashvili and Yezhov factions were already planning to run away.

They worked together to establish a new Soviet government and promised that reforms would be implemented. Bukharin said, "The reliance of people like Dzhugashvili and Yezhov on the NKVD's reign of terror has turned our Soviet government into a police state, departing from its original purpose ...... We must correct it, we must reform it, if the Soviet Union is to move toward peace and prosperity... ..."\n\n Bukharin had already announced the end of the purges, the end of the extermination of the "rich peasants", and the "peaceful entry into socialism".

The imperialists, who advocated "respect for the emperor and the traitors," have since taken control [JAP.GetName], and a series of purges to consolidate the regime have been launched, and Japan will probably remain in such a state of emergency until the emperor takes power... or forever.

On a dark and windy night, radical middle and lower ranking officers infiltrated into Tokyo with about a thousand of their troops and tried to gain the emperor's support to "punish the traitors" with the slogan "Respect the emperor and curb the traitors". \n\nThe impulsive and risky move was indeed difficult to achieve, and the government patriarch who heard the news quickly dispatched loyal troops to surround the coup army. \n\nHowever, Marshal Oda Nobunaga, who was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the rebellion, was also an ambitious man, and her army took the government with it, and a shogunate composed entirely of his cronies, the "Owari gang," began to establish its rule over Japan."

 more_News.69.d: "After a series of political assassinations by civil right-wing groups failed to achieve results, right-wing activists embarked on a series of more risky gambles. And this time, they won. Just a few days ago, a group known as the "Shinpeitai" demonstrated in front of Ise Jingu and Yasukuni Shrine, demanding the consolidation of national defense. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department then dispatched police to ban the group, but it was a trap. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department was soon overrun by rebel forces of the Shinbei, and naval aircraft were called in to attack the Prime Minister's residence. After a series of dramatic defeats, the Japanese Prime Minister's residence was also occupied. Right-wing activities sympathizer Hinanawi Tenshi were elected as the new prime minister, \n\n, and according to reliable sources, the "Shinpeitai" had close ties with the previous right-wing terrorist group "Ketsumeidan" and the radical military officer group "Kodoha". "It is easy to speculate on the direction of Japan's next political developments."

While many commentators were bemoaning the chronic death of Japanese liberalism, a new generation of liberals, still on the fringes of power in Japan's political arena, had by mistake assumed power, spurred by a series of recent political assassinations. But even so the current liberal prime minister has not been able to escape the censure of the various conservative forces, and after various hints of lobbying failed to produce a resignation in return, some scary gossip began to circulate in Tokyo--A coup is being prepared, and both sides are seeking the support of the military."

The establishment conservative forces in the government have been rapidly shrinking on both sides, while the House of Peers, the hardliners in the government and the radicals in the army have been sitting on their hands. After three consecutive days of martial law in Tokyo and the government's distribution of weapons to the public, the conflict finally broke out politically. The rebels in the army claimed that the new prime minister was a "traitor" and had "defied the emperor" and demanded that the Speaker of the House of Peers, Yakumo Yukari, be installed as interim prime minister. The rebels then marched to Tokyo and collided with government troops on the outskirts of the city. \n\n The liberals, having gained enough support in the government, proved themselves to be no vase, and the army loyal to the government began to engage the coup army, with the war spreading rapidly from around Tokyo to the entire Japanese archipelago."

 more_News.73.d: "Unexpected civil war brings Japanese politics to a very different end. Radical militarists in the army were eradicated, conservatives in the government accepted Japan's new political situation, and the new government undertook a number of institutional reforms. The most difficult and complex reform was undoubtedly the recently drawn up new constitution. The constitution clearly establishes Japan as a constitutional monarchy and explicitly excludes the possibility of the emperor interfering in the political situation and the military. Under the new constitution, the military is subordinate to the civilian government, the head of government is the prime minister, and the Diet has national sovereignty. As a compromise, the House of Peers was retained, but its power was restrained. \n\nMilitarist thinking was fading as radical officers were purged, the Shrine Board was disbanded, shrines became legal entities, but a proposal by radicals to close Yasukuni Shrine was shelved. \n\nAt the same time, the "Empire of Japan" was renamed the "State of Japan" as a symbol of the new era, and the prime minister declared his intention to reverse the previous foreign policy. Critics say the new government is simply promoting a "well-dressed imperialism", but some activists in Asian countries are already excited. Japan may still dominate Asia, but it may be a different Asia."
