However, he did not release specific details or the progress of the investigation into the incident. Many Soviet political forces speculated about what would happen to the state apparatus, while foreign countries cautiously remained on the sidelines, wondering where the Soviet Union would go in this "post-Dzhugashvili era. \n\nBut soon, Yezhov himself made an even more shocking decision. aAs Dzhugashvili's most loyal comrade, he would temporarily act as general secretary of the Soviet Union to ensure that the country would not fall into the hands of the "rebels". Yezhov called on the Soviet army and other administrative bodies to pledge their allegiance to him and stabilize the situation in the country as soon as possible. At the same time, Yezhov said that the murder of Dzhugashvili by the traitors had made it even more clear that the need and urgency of the purge, the enemy was still strong and the Soviet Union was still in a precarious situation. Therefore, he will work with the NKVD to carry out a more thorough purge to completely eliminate the space for traitors to survive. \n\nThe seemingly sensational purge will not die out with the death of Dzhugashvili; the political struggle in the Soviet Union is about to enter a more brutal phase."

Tukhachevsky's army is valiant and has taken control of many of the capital's major urban areas. Some military personnel loyal to Yezhov and some internal affairs units attached to the NKVD engaged in heavy fighting with Tukhachevsky's troops, with gunfire echoing thickly over Moscow and citizens hiding in fear in their homes while waiting for the fighting to die down. \n\nSome Soviet officers expressed their approval of Tukhachevsky's mutiny and saw it as the fastest way to end the Great Purge and get the Soviet Union back on track. They had begun to respond to Tukhachevsky by helping him hold off other armies and take control of Moscow. The Soviet capital was gradually falling into the hands of the heady Chief of General Staff, and it looked like he was inching toward victory. \Whatever the outcome, the mutiny, which took place at the heart of the Soviet Union, made the future of the Soviet Union even more uncertain.

He was Trotsky, who was known as the "father of the Red Army". Invited by Tukhachevsky, he returned to the Soviet Union in secret. \n\nAfter a brief exchange of pleasantries, Tukhachevsky invited Trotsky to become the General Secretary of the Soviet Union. He was well aware that he was not a professional politician and that his old aristocratic origins were not enough to convince the people. He believed that Trotsky represented the Marx and Bolshevism in his heart, and therefore made special arrangements to welcome Trotsky back from exile. Now that "Comrade Lenin's close comrade" had returned, would he be able to lead his long-lost homeland?

Moscow and Leningrad were under martial law, other major Soviet cities were under military control, and despite Tukhachevsky's public promises that the junta was a last resort to stabilize the situation, some officials formerly belonging to the Dzhugashvili and Yezhov factions were already planning to run away.

They worked together to establish a new Soviet government and promised that reforms would be implemented. Bukharin said, "The reliance of people like Dzhugashvili and Yezhov on the NKVD's reign of terror has turned our Soviet government into a police state, departing from its original purpose ...... We must correct it, we must reform it, if the Soviet Union is to move toward peace and prosperity... ..."\n\n Bukharin had already announced the end of the purges, the end of the extermination of the "rich peasants", and the "peaceful entry into socialism". The conservatives in the party scoffed at Bukharin's statement, considering it "the extinction of the class struggle" and "the first signs of capitalism".

In response to outside questions, they produced local journalists' photos of the bombing site, on which the buried duo could indeed be faintly seen in the rubble. In addition, the Hungarian government has so far made no move and Budapest has fallen silent.

Under the new constitution, the military is subordinate to the civilian government, the head of government is the prime minister, and the Diet has national sovereignty. As a compromise, the House of Peers was retained, but its power was restrained. \n\nMilitarist thinking was fading as radical officers were purged, the Shrine Board was disbanded, shrines became legal entities, but a proposal by radicals to close Yasukuni Shrine was shelved. \n\nAt the same time, the "Empire of Japan" was renamed the "State of Japan" as a symbol of the new era, and the prime minister declared his intention to reverse the previous foreign policy.
