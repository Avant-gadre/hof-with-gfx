 russian.1.t:0 "To the west! To the west!"
 russian.1.d:0 ""The winners are widely praised, and their stories will continue to be handed down, while the losers disappear in the dust of history and are regarded as rebellious people. Let us decide who is the sinner in Russian history now!""
 russian.1.1:0 ""Ura!!""

 russian.51.t:0 "The civil war in Russia starts again."
 russian.51.d:0 "After being defeated by the German Empire in the last war, the huge Russian empire was finally completely crushed, and Lenin led the so-called proletariat to successfully control the capital and gain an advantage in the civil war. However, the timely intervention of the Japanese made it impossible for the Red Army to break through the Siberian wilderness, and the rumors of "the dead queen suddenly came back to life." suddenly boosted the morale of the White Army and even launched a counteroffensive. Soon the war fell into a stalemate in the Siberian wilderness, and the two sides, who could not continue, spent two decades of tension over the ceasefire line. Until [RUS.GetName] took the lead in breaking the silence on the ice sheet, it is clear that the losers of the present are more committed to taking back the past, but can they defeat the long-developed [SOV.GetName] who have been lingering on the frontier for a long time? Whatever the outcome, the day of Russian reunification is just around the corner."
 russian.51.1:0 "Take back our world!"
 russian.51.2:0 "No more next time!"
 russian.51.3:0 "It's going to take a while!"  
 
 russian.2.t:0 "Meet with the top brass of the army"
 russian.2.d:0 "The top brass of the army, represented by General Lavr Kornilov and General Wrangel, do not seem satisfied with tsarina's return, but the czar Anastasia thinks their doubts can be resolved. With a premonition that civil war will break out again, if she shows the veterans that she is very different from her incompetent father, then perhaps the army will support her subsequent political decisions and military command."
 russian.2.a:0 "The talks do not go well."
 russian.2.b:0 "There has been little progress in the talks"
 russian.2.c:0 "The generals have changed their minds!"
 
 russian.3.t:0 "Meet with the top brass of the navy"
 russian.3.d:0 "General Kolchak of the Navy used a coup to overthrow the interim government and served as the supreme leader of the Russian government. Although as a Republican, he initially opposes the succession of the tsar to the throne at Chita, his Majesty believes that his attitude is not unchangeable and only needs to convince him of his abilities. Kadoc will also attend the talks between the czar and General Kolchak."
 russian.3.a:0 "The talks do not go well."
 russian.3.b:0 "There has been little progress in the talks"
 russian.3.c:0 "The generals have changed their minds!"
 
 russian.5.t:0 "Coup!"
 russian.5.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] actions against the democratic opposition have angered disgruntled White Army leaders who are preparing to launch a small coup to force the czar, who inspected the situation in Vladivostok, to abdicate. At the same time, black coalition extremists in the army and fascists dormant in Harbin have smelled the coup. They may stop the coup by colluding with paramilitary groups in the Fengtian region or with the Japanese Kwantung Army. And turn the tsar into their puppet."
 russian.5.a:0 "The coup is successfully completed and [ROOT.GetLeader] is forced to abdicate."
 russian.5.b:0 "The black coalition sabotages the coup, and [ROOT.GetLeader] is forced to accept the demand."
 
 russian.6.t:0 "The leader of the Military Government"
 russian.6.d:0 "After successfully forcing tsar to abdicate in the Vladivostok incident, the junta began to discuss who should be the supreme leader of the White Army movement. Ironically, the personal will of the supreme leader may determine the fate of the White Army movement."

 russian.7.t:0 "An unexpected visitor"
 russian.7.d:0 "Kadoc returned to his small pavilion in Chita after a day's work. His residence is as simple as his clothes. Indeed, his low profile lifestyle and secretive whereabouts are out of proportion to his status as Russia's supreme leader. When he lit the fireplace to keep warm, he suddenly felt a familiar chill behind him. \n "Zaychik! I know it's you. Stop hiding. " \n When Zaychik emerged from the dark, Kadoc noticed that her legs had become prosthetics. "Zemlupus. Long time no see. Now you are a very busy man. " \n "Why are you here? Did Kerensky send you to kill me? Like how you killed Boris? " \n "Zemlupus, calm down. I killed a lot of people when I was young, but I didn't kill Savinkov. Neither Kerensky nor Lvov has anything to do with this. I'm here to talk to you in my personal capacity, just catching up between two old comrades-in-arms. " \n Kadoc can no longer hide his anger: "I have nothing to do with PSR now. We have nothing to talk about. Were it not for the weakness and incompetence of Kerensky and you cowards, the red bandits would have disappeared from the map of Russia! " \n "(sighs) Zemlupus, I don't mean to let you stay, I just hope you remember the promises and ambitions you made that year. Times have changed and we have all lost a lot of things, but there is one more thing we can do.""
 russian.7.a:0 ""Well, I hope all this is not disappointed.""
 russian.7.b:0 ""Enough! I have my own plan.""
 
 russian.8.t:0 "Kadoc's Promise"
 russian.8.d:0 "Kadoc Zemlupus promised his former comrade-in-arms, Bronya Zaychik, the leader of the Social Revolutionary Party, to restore democracy in Russia. Now that the war is about to be won, Kadoc knows very well that it is time for him to make good on his promise. The Kornilov incident and the death of Savinkov made him lose confidence in democracy. He was exhausted by the coup that overthrew Anastasia within the White Army and a civil war that was harder and more painful than the first civil war. Now, for him, it's almost over. Kadoc refused the invitation to return to the party and simply completed his transition to the new interim government. As for himself, he may be about to wave goodbye to his more than 20 years of political career."
 russian.8.a:0 "History is a cycle of reincarnation."
 
 russian.9.t:0 "Kadoc's Plan"
 russian.9.d:0 "Kadoc Zemlupus looked at the dark sky and a storm was coming. The Russian nation, like the muddy land in front of him, was repeatedly washed away by torrential rain. From the Kornilov incident to the October Revolution, from a dramatic retreat to a more painful second civil war. He thought about the people and things around him, his teacher Boris Savinkov, tsarine Anastasia, his former comrade-in-arms cloth Bronya Zaychik, his enthusiasm when he joined the Social Revolutionary Party, the shock and anger he heard about the October Revolution, and the fact that he used Tsarina of Chita to consolidate his power. He has done enough for all this, and Russia has paid enough for it. His eyes stuck in the dark eye socket saw the light and saw a stronger and tougher Russia, a great country greater and freer than any other country in Europe. He reintegrated the political forces he had developed and created the Social people's Republican Party, a more powerful group born out of SNRP. Under its guidance, Russia will rise in the ashes of the red bandits and get rid of the shackles of fate tied to the Russian people!"
 russian.9.a:0 "Long live Kadoc the Vozhd！"
 
 russian.10.t:0 "Let Kadoc into the government"
 russian.10.d:0 "There is no doubt that Kadoc Zemlupus is already a celebrity of the Chita regime. Since he quit the Social Revolutionary Party, he has actively wandered among the various branches of the White Army and courted various anti-Bolshevik forces. His excellent organizational skills gathered a lot of supporters around her. General Kornilov already knew his abilities and ambitions when he tried to ban the Petrograd Soviets, and now he wants to form a government with him to organize existing anti-Bolshevik forces and prepare for a future government."
 russian.10.a:0 "Invite him to come."
 russian.10.b:0 "Not necessary."
 
 russian.11.t:0 "Lavr Kornilov died of illness"

 russian.11.a:0 "Kadoc Zemlupus should form a government"
 russian.11.b:0 "The junta continues to operate."
 
 russian.12.t:0 "Reform of Berezovich Kryuger"
 russian.12.d:0 "General Berezovich Kryuger originally came from the Security Bureau and was a loyal general of the White Army. Because he did not have much interest in power and had a firm and frank character, he had many supporters within the White Army. The bitter civil war has made Kryuger tired of armed struggle, and in his view, only a representative government of professional politicians can minimize social conflicts and prevent Russia from falling into the next endless military conflict. Time will tell whether he is right or not."
 russian.12.a:0 "Retire at the height of career"
 
 russian.13.t:0 "General Aleksandr Kolchak died of illness"

 russian.13.b:0 "The junta continues to operate."
 russian.13.c:0 "Kadoc Zemlupus should form a government"
 
 russian.14.t:0 "Assassinate Pyotr Wrangel"
 russian.14.d:0 "A man claiming to be the brother of General Wrangel wanted to meet with General Wrangel, but the Security Agency had determined that the man was actually a spy for NKVD, and his purpose was to assassinate General Pyotr Wrangel. Now we can only hope that the security agency can stop the assassination."
 russian.14.a:0 "NKVD's assassination succeeded!"
 russian.14.b:0 "The assassination was thwarted."
 
 russian.15.t:0 "The fall of the Soviet Union"
 russian.15.d:0 "History has taken a startling turn again, and although we were nearly defeated by the Bolsheviks in the first civil war, our unremitting resistance and Bolshevik internal contradictions and divisions gave us a second chance. Now that the Bolsheviks have been defeated, two decades of repeated sawing has finally come to an end today, and history will remember this glorious moment in Russian history. Although there are still diehard communists resisting us, they will be defeated in the end."
 russian.15.a:0 "Ура!!"
 
 russian.16.t:0 "Tsarina's suicide"
 russian.16.d:0 "After the Black League defeated an anti-tsar coup within the White Army, Tsar Anastasia I had to appoint key members of the Black League to important positions and allowed the Black League to incite ultra-nationalism in the countryside to expand support. Perhaps with a premonition of her own fate after the end of the war, Anastasia I escaped the close surveillance of the Black Alliance and slit her wrists in her study at the Winter Palace. Although the accident caused chaos, it also created an opportunity for the black coalition and the direct rule of the fascist party of all Russia. Now, who is the real head of state of Russia?"
 russian.16.a:0 "Konstantin Rodzaevsky！"
 russian.16.b:0 "Anastasy Vonisastky！"
 russian.16.c:0 "Mikhail Matkowski！"
 
 russian.17.t:0 "The action of "DEFY""
 russian.17.d:0 "As one of the four senior officers of the Defiance Squatron, Ruchnoy Kalashnikova has her own plans for the coup. She has hated the days when the army was played between the metacarpal bones of Russian politicians and careerists, whether it was the Bolsheviks, the social revolutionaries or the black coalitions. She wants to really dominate all this and become a spokesman for a new era rather than cannon fodder. After killing Rodzaevsky, she chose to betray her comrade-in-arms. If she succeeds, she can become the new head of state of Russia in the name of thwarting the rebellion. She knew that she could only gamble, and that just a few hours would determine the fate of her and the whole of Russia."
 russian.17.a:0 "The DEFY's action was successful"
 russian.17.b:0 "The coup failed and key personnel were killed."
 
 russian.18.t:0 "The rebellion of Ruchnoy Kalashnikova"
 russian.18.d:0 "As one of the four senior officers of DEFY, Ruchnoy Kalashnikova had her own plans for the coup. She hated the days when the army was played between the metacarpal bones of Russian politicians and careerists, whether they were Bolsheviks, social revolutionaries or black alliances. She wanted to really dominate all this and become a spokesman for a new era rather than cannon fodder. After killing Rodzaevsky, she chose to betray her comrade-in-arms. If she succeeds, she can become the new head of state of Russia in the name of thwarting the rebellion. She knew that she could only gamble that just a few hours would determine the fate of her and the whole of Russia."
 russian.18.a:0 "Her rebellion succeeded!"
 russian.18.b:0 "Her rebellion failed and the junta ordered a martial law."
 
 russian.19.t:0 "Imran Zakhaev's Revolution"
 russian.19.d:0 "As a staunch nationalist and revanchist, Imran Zakhaev decided to transform Russia into an invincible bastion of nationalism that could not be tainted by Europe's dangerous socialism and liberalism after a complete defeat of the Bolsheviks. For him, this is a great "revolution"."
 russian.19.a:0 "Ypa!!"
 
 russian.20.t:0 "General Election"
 russian.20.d:0 "Russia has not held a real election since the Constituent Assembly was sabotaged by the Bolsheviks in 1917. Now the Bolsheviks have been defeated and the autocratic rule of tsar has come to an end. It is time for real democracy to return to Russia. What is the result of the general election?"
 russian.20.a:0 "The moderate and conservative October Party won."
 russian.20.b:0 "The liberal Constitutional Democratic Party won."
 russian.20.c:0 "The return of Socialist Revolutionary Party supported by farmers"
 russian.20.e:0 "The Menshevik of Social Democracy won the election."
 
 russian.21.t:0 "Secularization"
 russian.21.d:0 "The current ruling party insists that we need a modern secular government. Now the church will be forcibly separated from the state, and the process must be painful. Although the upper echelons of government have separated from the church, much remains to be done to deprive the clergy of their political privileges and reduce the church's political influence."
 russian.21.a:0 "A free Russia is beckoning."
 
 russian.22.t:0 "Change the ethnic policy"
 russian.22.d:0 "Because of the new changes in the politics of our country, the promises made by the old government to the ethnic minorities can be abolished."

 russian.23.a:0 "It's time now."
 
 russian.24.t:0 "Rename the city"
 russian.24.d:0 "The Bolsheviks changed the names of a large number of cities in the name of "removing traces of rule of tsars", turning them all into the names of their "revolutionaries". This act of undermining the continuity of history is essentially not just a new personality cult for their rulers. In any case, now that we have won, it is time to erase the traces of red bandits from the map of Russia."
 russian.24.a:0 "Change the flag."

Now, most of the right-wing Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and Constitutional Democrats had to go into exile. In an auditorium in Prague, the capital of [CZE.GetName], these exiles held a modest celebration to mark the 20th anniversary of the February Revolution.

The two men pushed aside the security guards who tried to block him and stormed into the meeting, singing "God Save the Tsar" and fired several shots at Milyukov, who was making an impassioned speech, knocking him down. Just as another assassin was about to shoot Chernov, Nabokov, a member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, rushed forward and tackled him. Taboritsky immediately pulled the trigger on Nabokov several times and killed him on the spot. Afterwards, Milyukov was pronounced dead due to incomplete resuscitation. There is no doubt that this incident dealt an even more fatal blow to the already weak democratic opposition in Russia."

Suddenly, as if the sky was spinning, she felt herself surrounded by a red mist. She heard gunshots, heard her sisters' cries, but could not see them. The gunshots were getting closer and closer to her, and she felt more and more fear. Suddenly, she saw "that thing", the white light in the red fog, and her instincts told her that she could still live, that the country was still waiting for her to rule. She stepped forward, she looked at the light, she closed her eyes, she reached out her hands, she held the hope. But instead of touching "that thing", she touched a hand. Her eyes snapped open and she saw an all-too-familiar young face. Yes, it was him. \n\nAlexei, her little brother. \n\nAnother shot rang out, just to her left, she couldn't wait any longer, she pushed her brother away violently and clutched the light, the whole world was engulfed in light, she felt a flash in her eyes ......

 russian_flavour.5.d:0 "While Tsarina Anastasia has long been recognized by most conservative forces as the heir and symbol of Russian tradition, the question of her successor and spouse has long lingered. Obviously, it is a question of whether the Romanov dynasty will continue successfully, and there are a number of social and political problems associated with it. Although the young and beautiful tsarina was the ideal marriage partner for many European noblemen, and perhaps even more tempting was the vast land she represented. But the tsarina had always been incredibly fond of the commoner Kadoc, a former social revolutionary. Inevitably, the conservative ministers were not happy about this.\n\nKadoc Zemlupus, who had sincerely followed the ideals of the Republic, was a close friend of Savinkov. But after the famous Bolshevik riots, the death of his friend turned him against the republican government headed by Kerensky and into the arms of the conservatives. The history of 1917 made most of the old nobility and ministers wary and even distant, even fearing that Kadoc was trying to "convert" the tsarina with his republican ideas. As for Kadoc himself, he had mixed feelings about the return of the monarchy, despite the disillusionment caused by the republican infighting.\n\nToday, on a day of great significance for all of Russia, the court officially announced that the tsarina and Kadoc would be married. This is perhaps the first time in the history of the Russian monarchy that a marriage between a royal and a commoner has taken place. In this sense, the Tsarina's bravery and determination were side-splitting. The answer to the question of how the Tsarina touched this melancholy and confused young man may be difficult for an outsider to know. And the world should also admit that love does not need a reason. Perhaps it was the love that crossed the status that made the queen choose him over others and finally touched his heart. In his most difficult moment, she accepted him with her tenderness and tolerance, not as a queen, but like an ordinary young girl accompanying him. In the face of true love, identity and other shackles are so pale and powerless, the Queen's courage is incredible, as determined as she was when she picked up the burdens of her country.\n\n"I am honored ...... not because I am marrying the tsarina of the largest empire in the world in terms of size, but because, she is the person I love most in this world. We will join hands and make everyone in Russia as happy as we are today."\n\nAlthough it was one of the liveliest days in the whole of Russia, the tsarina's wedding will certainly become a political event that will affect the whole of Russia, and what will happen in the future is difficult for anyone to predict. The story of Ekaterina II and Pozhangin seems to continue in this ancient empire ......"

 russian_flavour.6.d:0 ""Where did the soul of our God go after his death? According to the creed of the Church, He went down with His Word into hell to release the souls of those who trusted in Him." The climate in \n\n Ekaterinburg was unusually cold, and the lilting, deep chanting of the Moscow Patriarch loomed in the biting wind, as if a signal from heaven. The crowd stood in silence, from imperial government officials to other royal sidekicks, each with a stony face, looking ahead at the tsarina standing in the wind. The Queen's cloak and hair fluttered in the wind, and the gloomy atmosphere seemed to transport everyone to that dark summer night in 1918. \n\nWhoever it is, commemorating one's martyred family members is a rightful claim all over the world. But the Queen seemed more interested in turning it into a meaningful political movement. The tsarina has agreed with the Russian Orthodox Church to posthumously canonize her parents, three sisters and one brother as martyr saints, and the brand new "Church of All-Saints" has been built for this purpose. The official and public posthumous canonization and commemoration not only declared the empire's continued anti-Bolshevik stance, but also more or less challenged the legitimacy of the February Revolution. It was, after all, the movement that destroyed her father's throne. As a result, the commemoration was attended mostly by churchmen, nobles and monarchists in the government. Even though they had little blood ties to the Romanov dynasty, people could not help but be affected by the heavy and solemn atmosphere, with some of the women covering their faces with handkerchiefs and sobbing silently. People followed the tsarina in silence and walked through the doors of the church. The \n\n white church was built on the site of the Ipatiev villa. Under the guidance of the Patriarch, the Queen took off her hat and knelt before the icon and the cross and whispered her prayers. The deafening gunfire and incredible bloodshed of those days were far away, and one had to wonder at the vagaries of God's will when one miraculously escaped death and led Russia again out of the Bolshevik reign of terror. The memories of the horrors of those days came back to her, and teardrops could not stop flowing from her tightly closed eyes. It was a tribute to her lost loved ones, and a remembrance of the plagued homeland, groaning in the beacon of civil war and the gloom of defeat in World War I. With a chant from the Patriarch, it was all over for Tsar Nicholas II, may he be laid to rest. \n \n "Perhaps, the Russian people, born in the present, will not understand how the Russians, back then, could be so cruel. That is why we chose to build a church here. Hatred and prejudice only bring division and killing. We remember the innocent who were martyred, not for hatred, but for not forgetting. What happened to my father is a constant reminder that if we let hatred take over our minds, all will be lost for Russia. May all people, never forget what horrible sins have been committed in the land where we live ......"\n\n the end of the ceremony, the tsarina addressed the nation. In the foreseeable future, it may become a place of pilgrimage for successive tsars and monarchists, as well as a scar of mixed feelings in the hearts of republicans. But no one can deny that, for the moment, only the tsarina can bond the Russian forces and keep the country from splitting up again or even collapsing. The memory of history cannot be forgotten, and the purpose of remembrance is not to hate. The brand new Church of the Dripping Blood is spotlessly white, while the ground beneath it, in the Tsar's opinion, is tainted with uncountable original sins ......"

 russian_flavour.7.d:0 "As in the decisive battle of 1917, the soldiers of the Russian Empire stormed the Winter Palace after paying a heavy price in casualties. A corporal tore down the red flag of the Soviet government, hoisted the traditional Russian tricolor and elicited a frenzy of cheers. The recapture of St. Petersburg marked the restoration of the old imperial order, and the Red Army that had captured the place in the past fell as completely as the flag they believed in. The loyalists of the \n\n Empire saw this day as the "Day of Restoration" and invited the tsarina to return to the glorious city founded by Peter the Great and to take over the Winter Palace again. The return of the tsarina to the reign of the Hermitage marked the defense of Russia's monarchy, which had lasted more than 300 years. \n\nAfter the shelling in 1917, the Hermitage was reduced to a museum of the Soviets, and for the tsarina, this was not what she wanted. This was not what she wanted, and such a Hermitage was not enough to show the greatness of Russia. The royalists instantly realized that this was a perfect political opportunity to announce to the world the new birth of Russia and the complete return of the monarch. Although the building had not been damaged to the point of being uninhabitable, the tsarina decided to repair the Winter Palace and restore it to its pre-war prosperity. Despite the fact that the Russian economy, which had just ended the war, was not well-off, it was clear that this was a project that had to be done and was extremely important. The best architects, historians and theologians from all over Russia were brought in to direct the restoration. They were to make the Hermitage a palace again worthy of the status of the tsarina, "as beautiful as Her Majesty's appearance". \n\nDuring the restoration of the Hermitage, the tsarina sometimes stayed at the Peter and Paul Fortress or Mikhailov Palace. Some officials of the Imperial Duma criticized the great construction of the Winter Palace as a costly image project, and this argument provoked fierce opposition from the royalists. But no one can deny that the renovation of the Winter Palace has extraordinary political significance, and the tsarina, once thought to lack boldness and political maneuvering, is taking the first difficult steps to strengthen her ruling power. This magnificent palace will become her new fortress. \n\nThe double-headed eagle emblem and the fluttering tricolor flag at the top of the Winter Palace still glittering in gold took the tsarina's thoughts to faraway places, the Russian nation has gone through too much suffering, perhaps the next need to restore more than just a winter palace. But the tsarina is still young, time is still long, everything still has a chance to come true. To heal the wounds of this nation, it takes more than her efforts alone? \n\nThe long-lost sunlight was warm, and at this moment, as the distant Ekaterina II and Elizabeth I and other eloquent predecessors looked at her, she believed that the resilience and unity of the Russian nation could melt even the hard ice of Siberia. If she can fix the Winter Palace, she will surely be able to mend the rift in the hearts of Russians in the future, right?"

 russian_flavour.8.d:0 ""In any case, the war dead should never be forgotten. Their blood and lives irrigated the sacred Russian land." \n\nPerhaps with the exception of Tsar Nicholas II, who tragically died at the hands of the Bolsheviks, this was the grandest and most solemn funeral in Russia in recent years. Empress Anastasia led the entire Imperial Duma and the senior commanders of the army in a formal ceremony of tribute. In memory of the countless White soldiers who had died in the long Russian civil war since the end of the Great War. Thousands of people participated in the funeral, and squads of imperial soldiers, air force warplanes and armored vehicles gathered to honor the memory of those who fell under the guns of the Red Army. As a sign of respect, all high-ranking officials, military officers and members of the royal family took off their hats in unison and listened to the eulogy slowly recited by the officiating Patriarch. All the larger main churches in the country rang their bells to bid farewell to these lost lives. \n\n Although some members of the royalist faction believed that many of the armed nature of the White Guards were merely warlords who wanted to take over the mountains or try to restore the Russian Republic, none of them were supporters of the Tsar. But the empress insisted on holding this tribute, saying that it was thanks to their sacrifice that Russia was not completely destroyed by the Reds, and that whatever their position, they had given their lives for today's victory and the empire should miss them. The dead White soldiers were portrayed as "combat heroes" and "unyielding martyrs", and the Empress announced the posthumous award of the Order of St. George to some of the fallen White Guard officers as a token of the country's memory and gratitude to them. \n\n "Today is a day of national mourning ...... in the face of the Bolshevik threat ...... stand up ...... Russians unite ...... for the future of the country ...... to save the day ...... the blood of the fallen makes the Russian eagle more courageous... ...the power of example ...... God bless us ......"\n\n the Empress made a long speech, which was undeniably an attempt to strengthen national cohesion. While it may be difficult to unite Russians under the Tsar's banner as they did before 1914, the official recognition of the fallen White soldiers was certainly a move that united the majority, and they did forge a great wall of steel against the Bolsheviks in Russia's stormy times. \n\nFor the justice of the dead, the fallen may rest in peace. The crimson elements disappeared without a trace like dewdrops in the sun, the light fell on the Russian land, and the Empire was reborn. Under the leadership of Empress Anastasia and the new government, we will overcome one challenge after another and move towards a bright future, so that the brave soldiers will see in heaven that Russia has a bright future."

His Russian roots played an important role when the Japanese government needed an ambassador to Russia. \nThere are countless examples of his arrogance in the White Russian regime, and it is rumored that he used to exclaim that he was the real ruler of the Russian land when he had too much to drink. \nNow that Shinji is indeed ruling a small part of Russia, he has decided that from now on he will be the real ruler of Russia. He decided to change his mind and start his own path, so he started using the official Russian name "Makiri Sigisrenko", hoping that it would make the ruled look good to him."

The deliberately low-key style of action did not stop the major publications and tabloids, such as The Times, Time and other major media even opened a special section to track down the two men, but of course, so far nothing has been found. \n\nLast time the two seem to have been photographed in Mexico with former Red Army General Commissar Trotsky drinking together in a bar, a swarm of reporters only caught the drunken Trotsky, who was forced to be interviewed to denounce the evils of the degenerate workers' state to the camera."
