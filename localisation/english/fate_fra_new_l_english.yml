 alice_event.7.t:0 "Integrate logistical systems"
 alice_event.7.d:0 "Due to the modest success of Darnic's engineering station, the small experimental municipality established on the outskirts of Bucharest has taken shape. The Thousand Realms Tree group now has the ability to continue developing the engineering station, allowing it to take over important logistical systems in the military. This is certainly beneficial for increasing the influence of the Thousand Boundary Tree, but there is no doubt that it will also touch the interests of some in the military."
 alice_event.7.a:0 "It is necessary to do so."
 alice_event.7.b:0 "Forget about it."

 alice_event.8.t:0 "Integrate Bucharest Power"
 alice_event.8.d:0 "Miss Margatroid, who seems to be quite knowledgeable about electromechanical control, believes that integrating the electrical systems of Bucharest and the surrounding area into the Thousand Boundary Tree Engineering Station will improve the efficiency of both the bionic technology equipment and the electrical system itself. This is still the first plan initiated by this engineer of few words, but accepting her proposal would mean more costly investment and might trigger discontent on the part of the palace."
 alice_event.8.a:0 "But it's worth it."
 alice_event.8.b:0 "What does she know about electrical systems?"

 alice_event.9.t:0 "Building an armor research center"
 alice_event.9.d:0 "The Goliath remote-controlled tank designed by Alice Margatroid seems to have been a great success, and although it still requires a long wire to control, the remote-controlled tank has been able to successfully perform some difficult demolition tasks. Now the Vrvej siblings are proposing to expand our reach by establishing an armored research institute at the Thousand Boundary Tree engineering station, and this will also have a positive impact on our war with Hungary."
 alice_event.9.a:0 "Haha, good."
 alice_event.9.b:0 "Don't burden yourself"
 
 alice_event.10.t:0 "Reincarnation"
 alice_event.10.d:0 "Alice Margatroid seems to be nothing more than an elegantly subdued but somewhat eccentric engineer since she's been in residence. She always seemed to have a disdain for Darnic Preston, but also reliably single-handedly built a series of advanced engineering platforms for the Thousand Boundary Tree Group. But that's where Darnic Preston miscalculated. While he was obsessed with his total victory over Flanders III and the Iron Guard elements, this "engineer" stabbed him in the back. In fact, Alice Margatroyd had gained good relations with the military hierarchy when she provided the munitions design, and had planted some people in the electrical system and municipal authorities in Bucharest, in addition to Pachauri Norecki in the palace, who was also her mole. So, with the help of all the forces, Miss Margatroid successfully launched a coup d'état, occupied the experimental city of the Thousand Boundary Tree Group and commanded the garrison of Bucharest to declare martial law. Darnic was so clever that he lost control of Romania, which he had worked so hard for."
 alice_event.10.a:0 "How is it her!?"

 alice_event.11.t:0 "The Bucharest Trial"
 alice_event.11.d:0 "As key figures in the Yddgmellia group declared their allegiance to Alice Margatroid, senior government officials and some high ranking members of the military also came out in support of Margatroid to "purge subversive elements and German spies". After careful consideration, Miss Margotroyd decided that in order to ensure the legitimacy of the new regime, she should not disregard the law and use widespread political violence. So she decided to use the resources at her disposal to file a lawsuit in the Bucharest court against what she declared to be a series of "traitors" and to have the entire trial broadcast nationwide by the broadcast media. \Naturally, there was no doubt about the outcome of the trial, as Darnikc Prestone was convicted in absentia on multiple counts of abuse of power, collaboration with the enemy, and embezzlement. In fact, in order to protect himself, Darnic's confidant Forvedge brother and sister testified and provided a lot of internal information of the Yddgmellia Group to confirm that Darnic had "close unofficial contacts" with Germany before the Carpathian War. Subsequently, the Iron Guard capitanul Codreanu was also tried in absentia and convicted of unlawful subversion, murder, and unlawful incitement, and some core members of the death squad were sentenced to death in court and then taken to the execution chamber. \n Also tried was General Ion Antonescu. The secret telegram exchange between Antonescu and Codreanu was presented to the judge by the prosecutor, and after the judge read out the contents of the telegram, the senior officers who came down to the courtroom to observe the trial began to whisper and discuss -- obviously, they were shocked by the incident. Subsequently, Antonescu was sentenced to life imprisonment and stripped of all military rank and honors. \Alice Margatroid, known to the public with some fear as "the Puppeteer of Bucharest," sat in a seat at the bottom of the court and listened quietly to the trial, occasionally asking a few questions indifferently. Only those in the know knew that she had manipulated the trial."
 alice_event.11.a:0 "There is a surprising silence in Bucharest tonight."
 
 alice_event.13.t:0 "Alice Margatroid excaped"
 alice_event.13.d:0 "The power of [From.GetRulingPartyLong] has brought a major turning point in the political situation in Romania. On any harbinger night, Alice Margatroid detonated the Yggdmillennia laboratory she managed and fled the control area. Although the guard soldiers tried to intercept, Alice's pre-set remote control weapon successfully hindered the hunt. One day later, she jumped on the last ship that left Romania and fled the country."
