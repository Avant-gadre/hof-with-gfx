 UKR_Anarchist_open_depot_desc:0 "The Bolsheviks have decimated the Ukrainian peasants with their bottomless expropriation of grain for their industrialisation and confrontation with the Whites.

 UKR_Anarchist_Strengthen_discipline:0 "Strengthen the discipline of the Black Army"
 UKR_Anarchist_Strengthen_discipline_desc:0 "Despite the anarchist ideals united the Black Army under the black banner, components of the Black Army were, after all, soldiers, many of whom had served under Petliura and even Konovalets. Their presence must be severely punished for the looting of peasants and the indiscriminate killings."

 UKR_Anarchist_maximal_recruitment_desc:0 "Our resistance is weak in face of the Bolsheviks and even the White bandits, and although we cannot force the peasants to join our army, we must also address the problem of manpower resources.

 UKR_Anarchist_the_Reunion:0 "The Reunion"
 UKR_Anarchist_the_Reunion_desc:0 "Despite the very ambitious anarchist ideals of Makhno and the widespread popularity of his policies within peasantry, those who were really interested in anarchism were in the minority among the peasants and workers. After careful consideration of the gains and losses of the Black Army movement, Talulah Artorius decided to transform it into a more inclusive, more mobilising and more realistic movement- the Reunion. The Reunion is a mixture of anarcho-communism,syndicalism and radical republicanism that will maintain a strong mobilising and fighting capacity while promising maximum equality and freedom to its members."

 UKR_Anarchist_plunder_Soviet_collector_desc:0 "The Bolsheviks claimed to be the protectors of the working class and the poor peasantry, but were nothing more than the enforcers of a plundering policy under state apparatus eventually.

 UKR_Anarchist_keep_sanity_desc:0 "Frankly, it is not easy for an organisation like the Reunion, which emphasises both freedom and unity, to maintain organisational stability and broad mass support, but this is what sets us apart from the Petliulists and Leninists. We have to find a balance between maintaining the sanity of the organisation and tolerance for dissent."
 UKR_Anarchist_go_to_the_extremity:0 "Go to the extremity"
 UKR_Anarchist_go_to_the_extremity_desc:0 "The brutality of the White Bandits and the Bolsheviks has shown that a more combative approach than theirs is needed to liberate the Ukrainian people and indeed the people of the former Russian Empire from the oppression of tyranny.

 UKR_Anarchist_remove_antisemitism_desc:0 "The forces of Petliura and Konovalets have become a symbol of anti-Semitic terror, basing their so-called national liberation of Ukraine on the oppression of the Jews, and we must build a society of equality."

 UKR_Anarchist_redistribute_land_desc:0 "The old Ukrainian landowner class is trying to \"take back\" the peasants' land from the Bolshevik Kolkhoz, and this would never happen. The poor, underprivileged peasants must be given their own land to farm for themselves."
 UKR_Anarchist_tolerate_factionalism:0 "Tolerate factionalism"
 UKR_Anarchist_tolerate_factionalism_desc:0 "Factionalism is undoubtedly a poison to the Reunion, but if we punish them severely in the name of maintaining unity, we are no different from the Bolsheviks.

 UKR_Anarchist_direct_democracy:0 "Full and direct democracy"
 UKR_Anarchist_direct_democracy_desc:0 "Representative democracy in Western societies has proved to be a bourgeois hoax, while Bolsheviks' democracy in the Soviet Union was a sham democracy utterly devoid of content. Miss Talulah argues that only a full and direct democracy can truly reflect the will of the people. Even though such an arrangement would lead to less efficiency, we must meet the democratic demands of the people."
 UKR_Anarchist_regional_autonomy:0 "Regional autonomy"
 UKR_Anarchist_regional_autonomy_desc:0 "A centralised social sector, even if democratic, constitutes in itself a form of oppression in the regional sense. The only way we can have a true and equal democratic society is to give each region broad powers of autonomy."
 UKR_Anarchist_radical_republicanism:0 "Radical republicanism"

 UKR_Anarchist_trade_union_economics_desc:0 "The Bolshevik economic model has government at its core.

 UKR_Anarchist_pistol_and_speaker:0 "Black Terror"
 UKR_Anarchist_pistol_and_speaker_desc:0 "Anarchism itself is based on the general respect of the people for the common interest. If some saboteurs try to restore oppressive governmental institutions or destroy the consensus of the masses, we should destroy them by harsh revolutionary means. Clinging to bourgeois morality will only take us far away from the freedom to which we aspire."

 UKR_Anarchist_discipline_in_union_desc:0 "There is no contradiction between working class freedom and discipline in the workplace, and it is only in strengthened trade union discipline that the working class can find its rightful place in the collective interest.

 UKR_Anarchist_remove_Buldrokkastee_desc:0 "Buldrokkastee, known by the name \"The Patriot\", was in fact largely known by the name \"The Patriot\". His name in fact reflected to a large extent his consciousness that he was still loyal to the old Russia and the Bolsheviks. Despite his constant commitment to Talulah, it was only a matter of time before he became a stumbling block on the road to revolution. For the future of the Reunion, only the eradication of this stone stuck in the head of the Reunion will do."

 UKR_Anarchist_War_Sorelism_desc:0 "Sorel's understanding of syndicalism and proletarian purity was profound, but did not fully appreciate the role of armed forces and warfare.

 UKR_Anarchist_Operation_Chernobog_desc:0 "What Russian imperialism and its successor, the Bolsheviks, have done to the Ukrainian people is just part of a wider oppressive politics.

An attack on a major Russian city would just be a start."

The main resistance forces in the entire Ukrainian region are now unorganized, and some of the remaining OUN members have tried to take over the temporary office building in Kiev, but the building is also empty and in disarray. At that moment, the head of the anarchist military forces, Néstor Makhno, spoke to Ukraine's temporary radio station and called on the resistance to join him in the fight for a free and equal Ukraine. Some hard-line nationalists refused to obey Makhno, but many officers chose to join Makhno's forces. In this conflict, the anarchists won the final victory, but it remained an open question whether the anarchists could defeat the Bolsheviks."

 ukr_reunion.1.d:0 "Néstor Makhno was undoubtedly the most unique warlord in the Ukrainian regional war of 1917-1922. He led the Black Army that fought successively against the White Army and the Red Army, while he himself and his followers worked to destroy all governments and establish an anarchist democratic society based on peasants and workers. Although their struggle ended in a total Bolshevik victory in Ukraine, the flame of anarchism was still not extinguished. With the severe famine brought about by the Soviet authorities' harsh collectivization and food collection policies in Ukraine since 1932, the Ukrainian peasant revolt against the Bolsheviks was rekindled, and anarchism re-entered the Ukrainian landscape as an alternative to Bolshevism. \n Anarchist activity in the Ukrainian region was mainly guerrilla. The Moscow authorities generally considered anarchist guerrillas to be no different from ordinary peasant rebellions, but the situation changed after Captain Buldrokkas'tee, an officer under Tukhachevsky, led a part of the troops to join the guerrillas. Anarchism was seen as a threat on a par with Ukrainian nationalist organizations, and this continued until the outbreak of the Second Ukrainian War of Independence. For the authorities in Moscow and the Ukrainian Soviet government in Kiev, the most notorious anarchist bandit was Yelena Frostnova, known as the "White Rabbit". \After the outbreak of the Second Ukrainian War of Independence, Makhno also returned from exile in France to lead the anarchist revolution in Ukraine. Since the anarchists did not control the same areas as the nationalists, the two did not clash for the time being. With the fall of Petliura's government and the disappearance of Bandera, Makhno seized the power vacuum and, in one fell swoop, gathered a large number of Ukrainian rebels to join the Black Army. The time had come to belong to anarchism."

 ukr_reunion.2.d:0 "A Jew born in a village east of Lviv, Buldrokkas'tee served with distinction in the Tsarist army during the last World War, rising to the rank of second lieutenant. at the time of the 1918 Revolution, Buldrokkas'tee followed General Tukhachevsky into the Soviet Red Army and fought in the 1920 Soviet-Polish War against the forces of Jozef Pilsudski and Maena Nearl. During the Battle of Warsaw in 1922, he was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal and promoted to the rank of captain for his service in covering the retreat of the main force. During the Tsarist period, Buldrokkas'tee's troops were known for their good military discipline, and after joining the Red Army he was widely praised. \n\nWith the end of the Soviet New Economic Policy and the widespread implementation of the collectivization policy, the idle units were mobilized again to suppress the peasant rebellion in the Ukraine, to search for OUN infiltrators and to combat anarchist guerrillas. However, in 1933. During a food collection mission for the collective farms on the Ukrainian border, Buldrokkas'tee discovered that his son, whom he had left behind for a year, had died of starvation in his home, and that the troops not under his command had only been collecting food from his son's home, not even bothering to bury it. Shocked and outraged, Buldrokkas'tee led a part of his inner circle to defect to the anarchist partisan forces in the southern Ukraine. Such a serious defection of an officer shocked Moscow. Kaganovich was then removed from his post. And the repressive activities against anarchism were put on the central agenda of the Kiev side. \n\nUnlike the local Ukrainian anarchists who hid their Ukrainian nationalist tendencies, the West Ukrainian-born Buldrokkas'tee was so devoted to his Russian homeland that he was jokingly called a "patriot". He joined the anarchist movement out of sympathy for the brutal conditions of the Ukrainian peasantry and out of anger at the atrocities committed by the Dzhugashvili authorities. During his guerrilla campaign in the south of Ukraine, he adopted Yelena Frostnova, a partisan from the now Romanian-occupied region of Moldova, as his adopted daughter, who became the most feared partisan "white rabbit" by the Kiev authorities. It is worth noting that, unlike many Jews who joined the left-wing movement, Buldrokkas'tee was also a Zionist sympathizer. He believed that Theresia's promise of a peaceful and democratic Jewish-Arab state would be fulfilled in the end."

 ukr_reunion.4.d:0 "An emergency meeting of the Soviet of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies of Ukraine discussed the repercussions of the assassination of Makhno and how to deal with it. Since time was running out for a vote in the various local soviets, a simple emergency vote was taken by the soviet deputies still on standby in the Kiev suburbs. The result was that Talula Artorius, a deputy from the Kharkov region, won the vote and was elected as the new Black Army Gaitman. \n\nTalula Artorius was once the adopted daughter of a notorious old Russian nobleman, who ran away in anger because she could not stand the family's control over her and the cruel plundering of the poor peasants. During the Civil War in 1920, Artorius briefly joined the Bolsheviks and the Red Army, becoming a Bolshevik cadre in the local soviet in Kharkov, before being expelled for publicly criticizing Trotsky in the newspapers. Artorius then led some of her loyal cadres to join the Black Army under Makhno, and in the 1921 offensive against the White Army led by Peter Wrangel showed great leadership skills and charisma, and was widely praised by the local peasants. In Finland in 1930, she met Yelena Frostnova, a former comrade who was ready to return to the Ukraine first to start the resistance, and Alina, the editor of a local left-wing newspaper, and the three formed a friendship. \n\nWith the outbreak of the Ukrainian War of Independence again, Artorius and Makhno and others returned to Ukraine in succession to try to re-establish the Black Army. After the fall of Petliura's regime, Artorius gave a very successful speech in Kiev and persuaded some of the officers loyal to Petliura to join the Black Army. This greatly increased her prestige. Today, Talula Artorius has been elected as the new Gestapo of the Black Army and has become the new Batko ("Father") among many Ukrainian peasants. Talula Artorius was a little uncomfortable after being called "Papa," but she was ready to lead the whole anarchist movement to victory."

It was Alina who gave Talula Artorius firm moral support when she was at her most disillusioned. With the Black Army taking the leadership of the Ukrainian War of Independence, Alina decided to leave for Ukraine to support the cause of her closest friend. This was the first time that her ideals would be put into practice. Alina herself had no experience in armed struggle, but our revolution itself required a lot of work to help refugees and rebuild society, and Alina would be a great help in that regard. On the ship to Odessa, Alina is already talking to our pickups about establishing a school for the common good."

 ukr_reunion.6.d:0 "Despite Simon Petliura's claim that "the enemy of the Jews is the enemy of Ukraine," he did not have any interest in disciplining the officers under his command. For a long time, Jews were considered natural allies of the Bolsheviks because of the "Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy theory" that prevailed in the Western world. And because of the influence of old religious theology, many conservative officers also saw Jews as the enemy. As a result, repression and even massacres of Jews began to take place everywhere since the outbreak of the Ukrainian War of Independence. Despite the fact that after the fall of Petliura's regime a large number of troops fell to the Black Army and some of them had no intention of joining it, anti-Semitic activities were still prevalent everywhere. Despite the fact that Talula Artorius came to power and put out the fires, anti-Semitic activities continued. During a mission to rescue Jewish refugees, Talula's own troops searched a village based on intelligence and found that the village people had assisted the former Petliura army stationed there in inhumanely torturing Jews seeking food by starving them alive while locked in empty barns. It appears that these people gave the starvation brought about by the failed Bolshevik policy to their imaginary Bolshevik agents, the Jews. \nTalula was extremely angry after witnessing this atrocity, and the dream of creating a society where all peoples lived in harmony was mercilessly humiliated right before his eyes ......"

Despite the removal of Kaganovich, who was in charge of collecting grain, in 1932 due to the defection of Buldrokkas'tee, the imposed collectivization and food collection system still did not provide substantial relief. Moscow claimed to destroy the "Kulak" by collecting from the Ukrainian peasants, but the officials who came to collect were often richer than the richest "Kulak" in the region. This was represented by Leonid Brezhnev and his "Dnepr gang". Brezhnev, working as a deputy under Khrushchev, was keen to use forceful methods to seize grain and claim credit from Moscow, while at the same time he and his colleagues accumulated a lot of wealth during the collectivization process and stocked up on caviar in his family's warehouses. \n This bastard has now fallen into our hands. Brezhnev now cries and cries on his knees in front of Talula, claiming that it was all Jugashvili's fault and that he was only carrying out orders. buldrokkas'tee suggested that he be imprisoned or reformed through labor, but Talula seems to be even more indignant about Brezhnev's behavior."

While resupplying in the western Dnieper, Tallulah's immediate forces drove out a group of local militiamen who had unsuccessfully tried to fight for food, and then repelled a small group of Ukrainian nationalist organizations. However, Tallulah found that Alina, who was with her as she prepared to cross the Dnieper River, had been plundered and killed by the militia she had just let go in exchange for supplies in the next village. The marauders even cut off Alina's arm to take the basket and took the plain silver ring that Tallulah had given to Alina. \n Before she broke off, Alina broke off and explained to Tallulah that all this was not her fault, that she was on the right track, and not to be blinded by hatred and fear.

A number of local trade union representatives, especially those of industrial workers, were very uncomfortable with our ideas and ideals, and they seemed to prefer the Social Democratic Labor Party of Ukraine. These discordant voices were quickly countered by the representatives of the railroad workers' soviet, but still set off a firestorm of controversy. Many trade union representatives and some peasant leaders, who were also members of the Social Democratic Labor Party and the former Social Revolutionary Party, demanded that we restore the Central Rada, have nationwide representative universal suffrage, and stop the unchaptered redistribution until legislation was passed. \nThese blatant demands for the restoration of bourgeois democracy will naturally not be treated well by us.

She could no longer tolerate any further challenges to her authority, especially when a group of social democrats openly opposed her revolutionary plans at the Soviet Congress. She demanded that Reunion carry out a complete "revolutionary repression" of these "counter-revolutionaries, bourgeois politicians and Bolshevik saboteurs". It is clear that the Social Democratic Labor Party and Reunion itself have been entangled since the fall of the Petliura regime and the mass defection of its personnel. The liquidation of the Social Democratic Labor Party would undoubtedly require another "revolution" against many urban unions and a considerable number of agricultural cooperatives, and a considerable number of union leaders and village council representatives would have to be implicated."

To some extent, these criticisms have been valid, especially since the Black Army grew and Reunion was founded. But these criticisms were soon weakened by Reunion's purge of internal social democrats, as Reunion itself moved toward a state of informal violence and terror as an alternative to state violence. Obviously, at least in terms of results, this was very different from what Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Makhno had envisioned, but it seemed so natural that the slow-witted could not detect it for a moment. In any case, Reunion has now become Talula Artorius' machine for revolutionary terror, fueled by hatred of the rebels. For Talula, she could not tolerate any more obstacles on the road to her utopia, all enemies, factionalists, Bolsheviks, Moscow and Warsaw, they all had to be destroyed."

"Talula Artorius was no longer prepared to give Bodrokasti any room for rebuttal, but the young woman was still wary of facing the battle-hardened veteran, a brilliant orator and an inspiring leader, but she had not served under Makhno for so long. Bozokasti, on the other hand, was a commander who had fought outside Warsaw, in Lviv, and in the Crimea. \n \n "Miss Artorius, I understand your ambition to bring more people into the free zone and your urgent need to expand your ranks. But I, as a professional military man, have claims that I must uphold. I do not believe that our forces are sufficient to enable us to advance into the Donbass, especially since you continue to give away supplies that could have fed our soldiers to the units that broke away from the Black Army." The old codger always wore a black helmet that made it impossible to see what expression he was wearing, but everyone in the command had caught a whiff of sharp conflict. \n\nTalula became a little agitated. Frostnova sat on a makeshift bench in command staring at the map without saying a word, but her eyes were clearly not on the Dnieper, nor on the Donbass. Néstor Makhno had not said anything about turning the entire Ukraine into a free area, but it was clear that the Black Army was predominantly ethnic Ukrainian and predominantly Ukrainian-speaking, and liberating the entire Ukraine was the natural choice. But would the Russian-speaking regions of eastern Ukraine welcome her, Talula herself had no idea, but she felt she always had to try." With all due respect, I have to wonder if you are questioning my leadership skills or are losing faith in our cause. You know how Moscow has treated the people of the Ukrainian region for the last five years, and they will do the same thing if we give up Kharkov and Donbass. You know this better than I do, Mr. Bozokasti, after having dealt with the Russians for so long. Or should I call you by your elegant name, 'Patriot'?" \n\nThe word "Russian" had already raised the tension in the room, and Talula's naming of "patriot" added fuel to the fire. Yes, the Black Army is a team with internationalist ideals, and Reunion is an internationalist movement. Many officers and soldiers of Reunion hide their Ukrainian nationalism, and some of those who are attached to the Russian motherland are not aware of it, Talula and Bozokasti are just a few of them. Maybe Reunion can really keep its own undertones, or maybe Talula and Petliura are not so different in the first place.
