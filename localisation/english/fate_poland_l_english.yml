But as time went by, Witos decided to hand over the leadership of the party to Sona Flametail,who served as an officer in the army,younger and more energetic.\n\nFiretail himself is the leader of Pinus Sylvestris,a paramilitary organisation under People's Party.This has led to speculation that the Polish People's Party has grown tired of the peaceful approach to the struggle and that the appointment is a sign that it is beginning to draw in sympathisers in the army for military struggle.In any case,this handover has certainly increased tensions between the People's Party and the authorities at a time of growing political rivalry in Poland."

Now,in order to gain more advantages in the upcoming elections,the Sanacja needs to put forward a leader to shore up the facade. \n\nOne choice is Ioleta Russell, who is well known on all sides of Polish politics.Russell was one of the most successful of the military generals-turned-politicians from the Polish Legion era.She has had considerable influence in Polish politics, the military and the general public. However, Russell has repeatedly expressed her displeasure with the political methods of the Sanacja authorities since the Brest trials,fought for Vincenti Vítos and has become a sympathiser of the Polish People's Party.\n\nAnother option was Młynar Nearl.As the elder of the Nearl,he became famous at the Battle of Warsaw during the Polish-Soviet War and became the war hero most admired by Piłsudski.However,the problems of the Polish Republic caused he to become disillusioned and cynical. Electing Młynar Nearl as president might have gained much support, but it's afraid that he had no interest in defending the Sanacja regime. \n\nThe last option was McKee.As a spokesman for the business community, McKee's keenness to defend the interests of Polish capitalists without contradicting the Sanacja political principles made him unpopular in the army. However, his loyalty to the Sanacja and his flexible political manoeuvres made him one of the few businessmen to reach the top echelons of Sanacja's administration. Due to a lack of contact with the general public, many people do not know who McKee is.Choicing of him as president could affect Sanacja's popularity within the general public."

However, Dmowski and Biesławski have formed two cornerstones of the Polish nation, and both men's influence is deeply imprinted in the history of Poland. \n\nDemowski's death also points to the fact that the older generation of politicians have all withered away in droves.

They dragged the goods from the Jewish shops to the marketplace to be burned and prepared to set fire to the synagogue. \n\nTheir leader was Adam Doboszyński, a prominent national-democratic activist. A well-known nationalist writer, Doboszyński had been active in the national democrats for ten years, advocating an organic Catholic society and hating both liberal capitalism and socialism. He gave lectures on nationalism to workers and opened mobile libraries in the countryside to disseminate the party's publications. \n\nNow we can leave this to the local police, but the effects of this will be unpredictable. It has been suggested that the army should be mobilised to suppress the mobs and take the opportunity to sweep up and fight the right-wing militias. This would deal a considerable blow to the right-wing militias, but a massive military mobilisation might reduce the government's ability to intervene in other situations."

Earlier this year, Wawrzyniec Sielski, an MP from the Nationalist Party, was shot and killed by police. Doboszyński claimed that this was in retaliation and protest for this incident and that he himself had no intention of overthrowing the government. \n\nDoboszyński‘s defence aroused the sympathy of some members of the jury.

But as industrialization gradually took place, some peasants chose to sell their land and become employees of state-owned or private enterprises in the city, becoming Poland's growing proletariat. The development of industry also allowed for the production of a great deal of agricultural machinery, which gradually alleviated the problem of inefficient agricultural production.

Although he considered himself a Marxist, he only saw collectivization in agrarian socialism as a tool to counter the inefficiencies of the smallholder economy. In his view, Poland should have a mixed system of voluntary collectivization and private ownership of land. \n\nLimanowski's pragmatism provided an effective guideline for the Polish Socialist Party's agrarian policy. The collectivization today is the result of this approach in practice. Naturally, collectivization has never gone as well as planned, but neither has it had the Soviet-style catastrophic results that the right wing has always claimed."

 poland_hof.47.d:0 "Although not well known among the public, Maria Nearl's Morges Front was influential in Polish officer circles. This influence triggered alarm among a section of nationalists. The Polish Socialist Party, which had a great deal of experience in paramilitary struggle, soon picked up on the movements of some of the fringe organisations of the Nationalist Party. Information from workers' intelligence agents indicated that a Nationalist figure codenamed \"Platinum\" was attempting to organise the assassination of Maria Nearl and Sikorski, among others. It is likely that General Rydz-Śmigły was also aware of this. \n\nThis information was very important to the Socialist Party. Obviously, any movement by the Nationalist Party could be a lever for the Socialist Party against them. However, this assassination had little impact on the PPS itself. Perhaps it would have been more appropriate to let the Sanaçja authorities and the subversive elements of the Nationalist Party flame each other."

However, it seems that Centaurea is not the most senior figure in this organization. There are more powerful figures above \"Platinum\", such as \"Lazurites\", whose real identities are not known.\n\nThe suspicious part of this matter is that the information about \"Platinum\" comes too easily. It is not difficult to think that someone deliberately exposed or even leaked the information to divert attention. There is a possibility that Centaurea has been treated as an abandoned child by the Armorless Union, and if that is the case, then this may be an opportunity to take advantage of it."
