We are preparing to apply for the purchase of new combat ships, but we should first protect ourselves before responding in our country. Coastal defense ships with small tonnage and large artillery caliber will be our good choice. Designers from the local area have referred to the Swedish coastal defense ship. However, many Swedish designs have long been outdated. The final drawings of the designers have a much cleaner deck. There is a dual 305mm/45 Mle 1906 master on the bow and stern. For the gun, two 100mm/45 Mle 1930 dual-purpose guns were installed on the left and right sides of the hull. The full-load displacement of the entire ship reached 8,700 tons. Due to the limited technical capabilities in the region, we could only use outdated engines with a maximum speed of only 20 knots.

Each ship has a 100mm/45 Modèle 1930 dual-purpose gun on the bow and stern. 10 brand-new single-loaded Oerlikon cannons are installed throughout the hull. The anti-submarine side is equipped with a hedgehog launcher, 6 deep bomb launchers and 2 deep bomb slides, can carry up to 70 deep bombs, and are equipped with a new type of anti-submarine sonar. The entire ship is equipped with a large number of electronic equipment, focusing on anti-submarine and air defense, but a dual 550mm torpedo launcher is still installed in the midship to retain a certain amount of counterattack capability against large warships. The whole ship cost less than 1 million US dollars, suitable for rapid production and deployment. At the same time, the French East Asian Fleet Command also requested that a minesweeper be modified on the basis of this ship, torpedoes and some deep bomb launchers were removed, and large minesweeper equipment was modified. We will build a large number of frigates of this class and a small number of fleet special minesweepers in a short time to ensure that our merchant ships can safely pass through the Strait of Malacca."
