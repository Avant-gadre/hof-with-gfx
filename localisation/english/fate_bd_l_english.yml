An Admiralty official said slowly, "first of all, we must figure out what our strategic purpose is."Another naval officer stood up and went to the huge map of Europe hanging on the wall. "We are not going to fight a decisive battle at sea with the large-scale British fleet, our main purpose is to control the Mediterranean and attack the maritime lines of Italy. Only the capital ships with high speed can achieve this goal. In addition, our ships have to face the threat of torpedoes and aircraft, which also reflects the necessity of high speed.

""The advantage of the quadruple main gun is that the firepower is further concentrated, the main armor belt is effectively shortened, and the weight of the ship is greatly reduced, so more remaining design weight can be used for the power part and the air defense part. The defect is that the technology of our quadruple turret is not very mature, and its reliability will be affected to a certain extent. at the same time, the distance between the guns is too close, and the wakes interfere with each other when the projectile comes out of the chamber, resulting in trajectory deviation and increasing the walking surface. And because there are only two turrets, if one is destroyed in battle, the combat effectiveness of the whole ship will be greatly reduced. To solve this problem, armored bulkheads need to be set up in the quadruple main turret to divide the turret into the left and right parts.

The most serious problem is that the elevation angle of the 152mm  secondary gun used in the No. 1 warship can not reach 90 degrees of the predetermined target, and after the efforts of a large number of engineers, it can only reach 75 degrees at most. On the other hand, the elastic loading system matched with it is not mature, and the ROF is low, but it can not be maintained. At the same time, the rotation and pitching speed of the turret is not up to standard, so it is impossible to track fast-moving air targets. These problems meant that the gun could not complete the scheduled air defense mission, causing the six new 37mm automatic anti-aircraft guns of the No. 1 ship to become the only medium-range air defense weapons. Weak air defense capability has become the deadliest weakness of the new first-class capital ship. In order to make up for these defects, for the No. 2 warship that is about to start, we must find a way to modify the original design as soon as possible. Duke Richelieu has summoned Admiralty officials and Design Bureau engineers to discuss improvements to the No. 2 ship.

The gun uses barrel self-tightening technology, semi-automatic loading, elastic impact loading to achieve arbitrary angle loading. The twin guns share a set of pitching devices with a pitch angle of-10 to 80 degrees and fire integrated ammunition. High explosive projectiles equipped with timing fuzes and semi-armor-piercing projectiles against light targets at close range can be used with a firing speed of 10 rounds per minute.

Since the Navy wanted to start the construction of the No. 3 ship as soon as the No. 1 ship was launched, the Duke finally chose the A2 case, which was questioned, as the basis for the design of the No. 3 ship. The improved B3 TER project was selected as the basis for the design of the No. 4 warship with relatively plenty of time. The final design of the No. 3 warship continues the layout of the A2 case, which is similar to that of the No. 1 warship as a whole, and mainly adjusts the layout of secondary guns. The improvements are as follows: keep the secondary gun, cancel one secondary turret at the stern and change it to two knapsack layouts. This ingenious design provides additional control space for the new anti-aircraft gun and limits the weight gain to only about 50 tons. After the removal of the four twin 100mm turrets on both sides of the tower, the remaining two 100mm turrets are lightened to ensure that the weight of the superstructure does not exceed the standard, and after it is moved to the No. 2 main turret, the number of 37mm anti-aircraft guns remains unchanged, but the position is adjusted accordingly. However, this design relatively limits the firing range of the No. 2 main turret, which will be reduced from 286 degrees to 278 degrees when the two anti-aircraft guns are fired. On the other hand, all new 100mm guns are equipped with 30mm armour to protect against shrapnel and muzzle storms. In addition, minor adjustments are made to the front armor of each secondary gun to offset the increase in the center of gravity brought about by the knapsack layout."

 fn.11.d:0 "The B3 ter programme is an almost brand-new design and has been widely praised by the Admiralty. Its innovation lies in the average placement of the two main turrets at the front and rear of the ship, making up for the firepower behind the ship. The front 2 and rear 1 of the secondary gun is arranged on the central axis, which can also provide the firepower of 9 doors on one side. Both 100mm anti-aircraft guns and 37mm anti-aircraft guns have increased from 6 to 8. All anti-aircraft guns are installed on the side of the open firing boundary, which is far away from each other, and each group is controlled by a controller, so that there is less interference with each other, and the efficiency of air defense is significantly improved. The front two knapsack layout 152mm secondary guns can also provide strong support for the forward direction of the greater threat of torpedo strikes. The armored area of the whole ship is only less than 4 meters longer than the No. 1 ship, and thanks to a reasonable layout, the weight has been reduced by 360 tons. The final design scheme of the No. 4 warship follows the basic layout of the B3 ter case, but the difference lies in that the catapult is moved back to the stern, the layout of the new battleship of the US military is adopted, and the hangar is placed longitudinally inside the ship, which solves the problem that the firing of the original main gun affects the anti-aircraft gun. The protection of the secondary gun is further strengthened compared with the No. 3 ships and the front, side, top, and gun seat armor have been improved to a certain extent. As the secondary turret is reduced by 1 compared with the No. 3 warship, the exposed chimney above the main deck is also allowed to enhance protection from 20mm to 30mm.

Germany immediately sent a large number of bombers and several ships in an attempt to destroy the aircraft carrier. Although Joffre sent three groups of fighters to intercept, the escort of German aircraft made it impossible for French fighters to take into account the bomber fleet. The first round of airstrikes flew over the Joffre, and under the ship's flexible evasion, the German attack did not work, but a destroyer escorted was hit by a torpedo and sank. The Naval Command received a request for help from the captain of the 'Joffre' and found that the only battleship that could arrive in the nearby sea area in a short time was the battleship Alsace, which happened to pass by this area while returning to Hong Kong to refuel after the mission. After receiving the order of reinforcements, the battleship Alsace resolutely went to the rescue and successfully arrived before the second round of airstrikes. At the beginning of the air raid, the powerful air defense firepower of 'Alsace' immediately shot down several dive bombers, and the dense fire network composed of dozens of anti-aircraft guns caught the German plane off guard and made it difficult to approach. On the other hand, the German ship was surprised to find that a battleship had joined the battlefield and mistakenly thought that French reinforcements had arrived, so it decided to give up the pursuit.

The rotation of the turret and the pitching of the barrel are driven by electricity and hydraulic pressure, and the firing is directly controlled by the RPC system controlled by the central fire control system. The two guns on both sides of the turret have independent ammunition depots and projectile lifting mechanisms, which can be pitched independently, and there are also two 90mm artillery firing flares on both sides of each turret to enhance the night combat capability. The hooded armor-piercing projectile weighs 1320 kilograms and is 200cm long, which is longer than the overweight projectile used by American battleships. The super-long projectile gives it excellent aerodynamic shape, making the trajectory farther and more stable. The SD23' propellant, which weighs up to 364kg per shot, enables the projectile to reach an initial velocity of 810m / s, giving it the world's strongest vertical armor erosion and the longest range. In actual tests, the gun eroded 582mm of vertical armor at 20000 (30000) meters. However, the high charge also shortens the life of the gun barrel, about 190 rounds. In order to alleviate the influence of the muzzle storm of the 4-equipped main gun on walking, the gun is equipped with a 0.06-second delay firing device, which allows the first and third guns to fire first, and a gyro stabilizer is installed at the same time, which significantly reduces the gun walk. the improved projectile system also enables the firing speed to reach 2.2 rounds per minute, which is the same as that of the American-made 16-inch naval gun."

The military had expected to build a regular aircraft carrier with a standard displacement of 25000 tons in the late 1930s, drawing on the operational experience of the Béarn. However, because France's imaginary enemy, Germany, was restricted by the Versailles Peace Treaty, bound by the Washington Naval Treaty, and France's financial difficulties, the French Navy gave up building aircraft carriers. Until 1936, the French navy still had only one aircraft carrier, and the ship also found many defects in its operation for many years, and the vigorous development of aircraft carriers by the United States and Japan also made the French navy gradually realize the important position of carriers in future naval warfare. As Germany became more and more disobedient to the Versailles treaty, the French navy began to reconsider the ship-building plan of the new aircraft carrier, and they put forward two options: one is to convert the original Ducken-class cruiser into a light carrier; the other is to build two 18000-ton neutral aircraft carriers. However, when the French authorities learned not long ago that the German navy had begun to build a Zeppelin class aircraft carrier, they immediately abandoned their previous idea and decided to start building a truly large aircraft carrier to counter Germany's actions and regain maritime superiority, codenamed 'PA-16''."

So she asked for the rapid expansion of a number of light aircraft carriers based on the hull of cruisers. As a result, the French navy accelerated the design of new heavy aircraft carriers on the one hand and began to study light aircraft carriers the size of cruisers on the other. Although designers have proposed that this modified aircraft carrier will have many safety and seaworthiness restrictions, such as re-laying the hangar deck above the original deck of the cruiser will raise the ship's center of gravity and cause lack of stability, the weak hangar armor will cause hidden dangers to the hangar and hull strength, and the narrow flight deck will make it more difficult for carrier-based aircraft to take off and land, but the dangerous situation does not allow any hesitation. Soon Queen Mary ordered approval to convert six of the Bayard class light cruisers being developed and planned for construction into light aircraft carriers.

Hangars, flight decks and islands mean a significant increase in the weight of the upper hull, resulting in a significant increase in the center of gravity. In order to solve this problem, the Navy decided to set up torpedo protection protrusions on both sides of the slender hull of the original cruiser, which can not only increase the buoyancy and stability of the ship, but also set up heavy oil tanks inside it to increase the endurance of the warship. at the same time, it can also enhance the ability to resist torpedo attacks. The modified light aircraft carrier is equipped with two lifts, which are arranged before and after the hangar, and equipped with a hydraulic catapult. In terms of armor protection, the 130mm waterline armor of the original cruiser can provide effective protection against 152mm guns, but in order to reduce the weight of the upper part of the ship, the hangar armor is thin, only 50mm, and the flight deck is made of wood with a layer of very light armor attached to it. The level of underwater protection is to add a torpedo protection bag on the basis of the original cruiser, which can defend against the attack of air-dropped torpedo to a certain extent.

Of course, the heavy armor also brings a disadvantage, that is, the center of gravity is on the high side, and the stability of the hull has decreased, so the freeboard height of the ship is lower than that of Joffre class, to alleviate this problem. To ensure that the carrier-based aircraft have armored protection at the shortest take-off and landing distance, the ship does not use the front, middle and rear lift design, but uses two larger front and rear lifts. Not only maintain efficient take-off and landing efficiency but also different from the 'brilliant' class unprotected lift, the ship's lift is covered with two pieces of 25mm armor, which plays a certain role in protecting the fragile lift. Another design highlight of the ship's protection is that the hangar has storm discharge holes and detachable steel plates, which helps to alleviate the hull damage caused by the explosion of the armored aircraft carrier hangar.

The British government, led by King Arthur, also declared that it welcomed the plan, and thus a binary state of Jews and Arabs was created. As a sign of respect for Jews and Arabs, the state was no longer called Isreal, but Isratin. Not surprisingly, critics of Zionism continue to criticize Theresia's "reforms" for not changing the colonialist nature of Zionism, and perhaps they are right. The results of this bizarre social experiment will perhaps only be tested by history."

 ISR_Babel_Program_desc:0 "Babel Program was an alternative to the Basel Program, the platform of the World Zionist Organization, which emphasized not only the need to secure a land for the Jews and to fight against world anti-Semitism, but also the social responsibility of the Jews towards the indigenous people of the land of immigration. This plan was soon put into practice by Theresia. It included a series of plans to build housing for Jews and Arabs, programs to develop the civilian economy, and attempts to reform and expand the traditional Israeli kibbutz (collective farm). At the same time, the Babel Program included a series of plans for military defense to prevent the fledgling state from being easily destroyed by outside forces."

If the Jews are to prove that they are entitled to the land, they need to first prove that they are capable of living in peace with the Arabs."
