Faced with this evidence, Heydrich could only declare the case closed. Despite his disappointment, Otto Strasser was very dissatisfied with the result of this "unidentified person assassination" and could only choose to accept it. Canaris said that the Military Intelligence Bureau would accept it. Further find out the specific identity of this person. "

Wessel, a Valkist theorist and party songwriter, was indeed killed by his love rival. However, another person had previously deployed bodyguards and shot Wessel accurately after the love enemy missed a shot. Both of these murderers cleverly completed their own assassinations in the conspiracy of others. If our police were not responsible for discovering the inside information, the case would have been closed long ago.

It turned out that this guy actually caught a homeless man from the distant United States by air transport to Germany and then pretended to be the real murderer. No wonder there was no information about this person in any search within the European continent. However, why did the director of the dignified military intelligence agency do this? thing? I vaguely remember that when he brought down the Social Democratic Party government back then, he was still a part of it. "Director, this news is really interesting, although we still have another equally interesting news." The man in fancy clothes still made a slick tone at the silent Heydrich. "What else?"

Hey, because of the good personal relationship between the two families on weekdays, Heydrich decided not to tell Canaris the truth, so that he would die in prison so confidently. \n\nThe real culprit currently presumed to be a lone traveler is still hidden in the dark, and according to the secret communication intercepted by the Dutch, this person seems to be more "impulsive". The last letter to Canaris claimed that " If I can't, I will kill the Commissioner", and the letter that Canaris didn't send only said "Don't be impulsive." \n\nAs the "Commissioner" Heydrich didn't dare to neglect, he had made all the preparations before going to the Palace of the Führer to report on the Canaris case, but today he went all out.

As the iron-blooded prime minister said, this can only be done with iron and blood, but the old empire suffered a miserable defeat in practice, so the Valkists under Siegfried adopted a brand new strategy. After defeating the giant bears that have squeezed the East for a long time, they showed a kind of care beyond the nation through the powerful industrial power of Germany, allowing the Germanic civilization to integrate into the various ethnic groups in the East with a friendly and stalwart image. \n\nUnfortunately, theory is theory, practice is practice. In the meeting, Heydrich listed the many problems in the implementation of Siegfriedism from the perspective of a realist. For example, we are almost fundamental in the battle. Unable to maintain a "friendly" image, the brutal repressive methods of the German army in the occupied areas are not much better than any army in history. \n\nBut this is not a problem with the German army, this is war! We are not idle to satisfy the aliens, and we must adhere to the principle of German first in all actions. \n\nThis is not abandoning popularism, we still accept collaborators, but those who do not follow...

 more_ger.108.t:0 ""Mediterranean Pseudo-History Examination""
 more_ger.108.d:0 ""The so-called civilizations such as ancient Greece and Rome are just myths concocted by intellectuals during the Renaissance!" \n\nMr. Alfred Rosenberg, a famous cultural scholar who is also our cultural commissioner, has recently published his new work--"Mediterranean Pseudo-History Examination", according to the book's rigorous narrative and arguments, the so-called ancient Greeks and Romans were nothing but looters and According to the book's rigorous narrative and argument, the so-called ancient Greeks and Romans were merely looters who plundered and stole the culture of immigrants from the far north. The main argument of Mr. Alfred Rosenberg is that the civilization of ancient Greece and Rome actually came from the Germanic people. Since the kind of conflict between the Germanic civilization in the Far North and the barbarians in the Mediterranean, that is, the Battle of Teutonburg Forest, the civilization from the Germanic region gradually shifted southward. Rosenberg pointed out not only that the civilization of Greece and Rome came from the Germanic people, but also that the process of transferring civilization to the south was accompanied by the degeneration of civilization. That is, the perfect spirit of Germanic nobleness, valor and fortitude gradually degenerated into the selfishness, weakness and calculation characteristic of the Mediterranean people. The rise of Florentine commerce and the Renaissance in the Middle Ages made the Mediterranean intellectuals dissatisfied with their historical destiny of being a marginal civilization, and then fabricated a large number of false histories of ancient Rome and ancient Greece. \n\nRosenberg also quoted extensively from German philosophers, from Fichte and Hegel to Nietzsche. According to Rosenberg, all these philosophers had actually recognized the falsity of Greek civilization, but were forced by the pressure of European cultural circles not to speak out. Rosenberg looks extensively at Nietzsche's works The Birth of Tragedy and Thus Spoke Zarathustra for evidence, claiming that the "spirit of Dionysus" advocated by Nietzsche is actually the "spirit of Siegfried" and that Nietzsche's discussion of Wagner's opera is actually Nietzsche's discussion of Wagner's opera is a kind of flashback to criticize the Greeks' shameless act of falsifying civilization. This claim is strongly supported by Professor Heidegger, a leading expert on Nietzsche. Rosenberg incidentally criticized Karl Marx, arguing that Marxism was a conspiracy by Mediterranean civilization to try to reverse the re-emergence of Germanic civilization. \n\naturally the book was met with widespread protests and abuse from forces outside ---- especially [ITA.GetName] and [GRE.GetName] as soon as it was published. However, the truth will not be refuted by a few mockery words. In the popular German radio program "This is Germany", Dr. Goebbels personally connected with the audience to discuss the "Pseudo-History of the Mediterranean", and almost every patriotic viewer who participated in the interaction fiercely criticized the shameless remarks of the "Romans". Dr. Goebbels also connected with Mr. Ribbentrop and asked him to tell his impressions of Nero when he met him in Rome. Dr. Goebbels quotes and proves that Nero's full body attire was actually an imitation of Arminius, the Germanic leader who defeated the Romans at the Battle of Teutonic Forest, proving once again that Roman civilization was in fact an imitator and successor of Germanic civilization. \n\nAlthough the book focuses on the fact that the Mediterranean countries forged their civilization, it also consistently mentions and praises the great ancestors of the People of the Far North--the Germanic peoples. It cannot be denied that the book still has a great political value, like other works of Mr. Rosenberg, and that some high government officials, out of the need to promote our great culture and ideology, consider that it should be treated as an official publication and that a war must be declared against the cultural theft of the Latin world!"

From their point of view, the full-length clothing of the Roman emperor Nero was imitated by Arminius, the German leader who defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest; all the military writings of the Greek General Achilles were copied from Clauser Witz and Guderian; even the religious literature and paintings of the Holy See are, in their opinion, copied from the "temporarily lost" works of the Teutonic Knights.

Under the leadership of Albert Schlageter, the heroic Rhineland workers began an armed struggle against French along with the local Freikorps. The workers turned on the boiler to release steam and screamed the Frenchman who was trying to occupy the factory. At this time, the ambushed Freikorps fighters immediately launched a counterattack. Although they failed to successfully repel the French army, the heroic actions of the workers and the Freikorps won a lot of support in the country and laid the foundation for the victory of the revolution in 1920. It also won the praise of Karl Radek and others from the Russian Bolsheviks. Many of the workers who did not sacrifice in the struggle joined the Reichsarbeitsdienst led by Strasser and became one of the important foundations of the VVP in the working class after the 1920 revolution. \n\nNow that our decisive battle with the Frenchman has arrived, the workers of the Reichsarbeitsdienst are no longer satisfied with fighting the German enemies only on the production line.
