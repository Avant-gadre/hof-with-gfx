 UKR_Anarchist_open_depot_desc: "The Bolsheviks have decimated the Ukrainian peasants with their bottomless expropriation of grain for their industrialisation and confrontation with the Whites.

 UKR_Anarchist_Strengthen_discipline_desc: "Despite the anarchist ideals united the Black Army under the black banner, components of the Black Army were, after all, soldiers, many of whom had served under Petliura and even Konovalets.

 UKR_Anarchist_the_Reunion: "The Reunion"
 UKR_Anarchist_the_Reunion_desc: "Despite the very ambitious anarchist ideals of Makhno and the widespread popularity of his policies within peasantry, those who were really interested in anarchism were in the minority among the peasants and workers. After careful consideration of the gains and losses of the Black Army movement, Talulah Artorius decided to transform it into a more inclusive, more mobilising and more realistic movement- the Reunion. The Reunion is a mixture of anarcho-communism,syndicalism and radical republicanism that will maintain a strong mobilising and fighting capacity while promising maximum equality and freedom to its members."

But the remnants of Petliura are still fighting the Bolsheviks and us on Ukrainian lands, and many are involved in the brutal looting of Jews and other minorities. These people must either choose to join us or be destroyed by us."

 UKR_Anarchist_plunder_Soviet_collector_desc: "The Bolsheviks claimed to be the protectors of the working class and the poor peasantry, but were nothing more than the enforcers of a plundering policy under state apparatus eventually.

 UKR_Anarchist_keep_sanity: "Keep sanity of the organisation"
 UKR_Anarchist_keep_sanity_desc: "Frankly, it is not easy for an organisation like the Reunion, which emphasises both freedom and unity, to maintain organisational stability and broad mass support, but this is what sets us apart from the Petliulists and Leninists. We have to find a balance between maintaining the sanity of the organisation and tolerance for dissent."
 UKR_Anarchist_go_to_the_extremity: "Go to the extremity"
 UKR_Anarchist_go_to_the_extremity_desc: "The brutality of the White Bandits and the Bolsheviks has shown that a more combative approach than theirs is needed to liberate the Ukrainian people and indeed the people of the former Russian Empire from the oppression of tyranny.

 UKR_Anarchist_tolerate_factionalism_desc: "Factionalism is undoubtedly a poison to the Reunion, but if we punish them severely in the name of maintaining unity, we are no different from the Bolsheviks.

 UKR_Anarchist_agricultural_cooperatives_desc: "Agricultural cooperatives are a model of agricultural business that can avoid the inefficiencies of a smallholder economy and eschew the exploitative policies of Kolkhoz, an approach that will ultimately prove to be a form of organisation that can balance, to a certain extent, the needs of the collective with the freedom of the peasant."
 UKR_Anarchist_anarchist_transport: "Anarchist teleport"

 UKR_Anarchist_direct_democracy: "Full and direct democracy"
 UKR_Anarchist_direct_democracy_desc: "Representative democracy in Western societies has proved to be a bourgeois hoax, while Bolsheviks' democracy in the Soviet Union was a sham democracy utterly devoid of content. Miss Talulah argues that only a full and direct democracy can truly reflect the will of the people. Even though such an arrangement would lead to less efficiency, we must meet the democratic demands of the people."
 UKR_Anarchist_regional_autonomy: "Regional autonomy"
 UKR_Anarchist_regional_autonomy_desc: "A centralised social sector, even if democratic, constitutes in itself a form of oppression in the regional sense. The only way we can have a true and equal democratic society is to give each region broad powers of autonomy."
 UKR_Anarchist_radical_republicanism: "Radical republicanism"

 UKR_Anarchist_trade_union_economics_desc: "The Bolshevik economic model has government at its core.

 UKR_Anarchist_pistol_and_speaker_desc: "Anarchism itself is based on the general respect of the people for the common interest. If some saboteurs try to restore oppressive governmental institutions or destroy the consensus of the masses, we should destroy them by harsh revolutionary means. Clinging to bourgeois morality will only take us far away from the freedom to which we aspire."

 UKR_Anarchist_remove_Buldrokkastee_desc: "Buldrokkastee, known by the name \"The Patriot\", was in fact largely known by the name \"The Patriot\". His name in fact reflected to a large extent his consciousness that he was still loyal to the old Russia and the Bolsheviks. Despite his constant commitment to Talulah, it was only a matter of time before he became a stumbling block on the road to revolution. For the future of the Reunion, only the eradication of this stone stuck in the head of the Reunion will do."

 UKR_Anarchist_loyal_to_our_cause_desc: "After a series of storms, we have good reason to believe that we have succeeded in ensuring the stability and further development of the revolution of the Reunion.

 UKR_Anarchist_Operation_Chernobog: "Operation:Chernobog"
 UKR_Anarchist_Operation_Chernobog_desc: "What Russian imperialism and its successor, the Bolsheviks, have done to the Ukrainian people is just part of a wider oppressive politics.

 UKR_Anarchist_ensure_ideological_integrity_desc: "The Reunion is a political movement that crosses ethnic and linguistic borders.

 ukr_western.1.t: "Muelsyse's legacy"
 ukr_western.1.d: ""The revolutionary boldness of the Russians and the pragmatic spirit of the Americans combined are the essence of Leninism in the work of the Party and the work of the State." So said Joseph Dzhugashvili in 1928. It is not necessary to say what the "revolutionary courage of the Russians" was, but the "Americans" were the American environmentalist, engineer, and now senator from New York, Muir Seth. The "work of the Party" here refers to the Dnieper River hydroelectric power plant. Anna Morozova's article claims that the Dnieper hydroelectric power plant was the first major step toward communism, but she and those at the top of the power hierarchy knew that they needed not only Soviet leadership but also capitalist efficiency to achieve their goals. The U.S. Army's Command in Chita had a staff of five or six men, and the White Russian government in Chita remained the only officially recognized legitimate regime in Russia, but this did not at all prevent a group of American advisors from being invited to live in brick houses in the "American Garden City" with two tennis courts and a golf course, to provide American expertise to the managers and engineers of the Dnepr River hydroelectric power plant, and to receive large orders from Moscow for turbines and generators from Newport News Shipbuilding and General Electric. At the head of these American consultants was Muelsyse. \n\nMuelsyse is the chief designer of the entire Dnepr River hydroelectric power plant and basin renovation project. As a young environmentalist and civil engineer, Muelsyse shot to prominence by designing the Toronto hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls and was previously involved in the treatment of the St. Lawrence River. Before she could negotiate a scope of services for the Dnieper River hydroelectric project, Moscow deposited $50,000 into Muelsyse's account. She immediately accepted the offer. The original planned investment for the Dnieper hydroelectric power plant was $50 million, however, by the time it was completed the investment had increased eightfold. Anna Morozova, a central figure in the Supreme Soviet, was on hand to preside over the completion ceremony. Speeches were made, praising communism, and Muelsyse and five other American advisers were presented with the Order of the Red Banner of Labor for their contributions to the cause of communist construction."

 ukr_western.2.d: "Leo Harvey, politician of the French Democratic-Republican Union and heir to a new generation of a prominent young French entrepreneurial family, now begins his journey to the Soviet Union. Although France was involved in the Soviet civil war with a small force to fight the Bolsheviks, the Parisian side was currently not interested in maintaining the lingering White Bandit regime in Chita due to its own political instability. After some politicians in Paris and Moscow had been exchanging glances for some time, Leo Harvey, the leader of the Democratic-Republican Union, finally decided to visit the Soviet Union in order to increase mutual understanding between the two countries. Leo Harvey was a standard big bourgeois in the Marxist-Leninist sense, but this did not prevent him from being greeted by an honor guard at the Kiev airport and staying in one of Kiev's luxurious hotels, picking up Ukrainian specialties from the foreign store. But this was not so easy and pleasant for the NKVD. The loyal NKVD officers had to fill the empty street stores with decorative food, hide the starving people a block away, and train the school children how to answer the French capitalist's questions. Also, guard against the dastardly assassinations of Ukrainian nationalists and anarchists. \n\nLeo Harvey was very pleased with his visit, and at the school called "Familiy of Felix Dzerzhinsky" he learned that the pupils could eat grilled fish or beef every week. He was soon introduced to the advanced achievements of Soviet industrialization. It seems that he had a lot of preconceptions about the Soviet Union, but that could not be helped, after all, he was a capitalist. \n\nHarvey was also a gourmet, but he always ate in moderation and with a balance of meat and vegetables so that he did not get fat. His next stop was Moscow, where he would taste the most authentic caviar bread and beet soup. Upon his return to Paris, Leo Harvey called the Ukrainian collective farms orderly gardens, and Pravda happily reported Leo Harvey's assessment. The story ends happily."

 ukr_western.3.t: "Fallout from Yakir's speech"
 ukr_western.3.d: "In a recent press conference in London, Soviet exiled military officer Yakir angrily complained about the brutal political purges on the part of Moscow and the tragic results of the failed policy in the Ukrainian region. This accusation appears to have greatly discredited Moscow and their followers around the world, but it also smacks the Western world in the face just as hard. Still, Yakir's accusation is one-sided, lacking more evidence, and more civilians and politicians don't really care what is going on in Ukraine, with some still believing that the Soviet Union has been officially slandered. \n\n "Yakir's accusations are a complete fabrication," is precisely the position of Walter Duranty, a Moscow-based columnist for the New York Times and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. In his New York Times column, Duranty repeatedly claimed that Yakir's statement at the London conference was "a horror story of grandstanding" and that "there was no famine at all," but only "widespread deaths due to malnutrition-induced disease. There is no famine", but "widespread deaths due to malnutrition-induced diseases". This is quite close to the official position of Moscow. Duranty also pointed out that the so-called purges and famines are subordinate to a higher purpose: "You can't fry an egg without breaking it." . \n\nWhile our news media and politicians were arguing about it or watching, the Germans had already taken the lead in public opinion. The portly Hermann Göring claimed that the famine, as Yakir called it, was "all due to Marxism," while Siegfried's royal man of letters, Alfred Rosenberg, claimed that it was part of Moscow's "oppression of the Ukrainian people." The German propaganda machine has already begun to seize this opportunity to run at a fast pace, while our intelligence agencies are not yet able to confirm what is really happening in Ukraine."

Khrushchev was so shocked as the central figure that he had to stay in Moscow for a while to recuperate from the prison of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but he didn't forget Brezhnev and immediately recommended him to continue acting as the First Secretary of Ukraine under the new regime on the grounds of his "good performance" until the situation on the ground was completely stabilized. \n\nIn that case, Brezhnev's first order was to arrest the Mehlis, who was too much for the dog, but I did not expect that this guy was quite conscious that he was not in his office and residence, or the Black Sea Fleet called to say that the head of the Political Department suddenly came to the port of Sevastopol and took a yacht in the name of vacation but drove out of the territorial waters at maximum horsepower."

The Russian-speaking soldier didn't ask any more questions and let the wagon full of "cargo" pass through, expecting that the black-market grain wagon would "help" the folks nearby. \n\nAs the advance commander of the Ukrainian insurgency, Shukhovich thought it was necessary to dismantle the Bolshevik grassroots, and that it would be feasible to use the famine caused by the authorities to push people against the Red bandits, but the further east you go, the more people will think they are the "bandits," and it will take a lot of time to prove the legitimacy of your side."

According to the concept of "permanent revolution" put forward by Stepan Bandera, the head of the Ukrainian nationalist organization's propaganda, and Shukhovich, the head of infiltration operations, the Ukrainian nationalist revolution had to return the blood and violence to the Bolsheviks intact. Thus, Shukhevich planned a series of terrorist attacks against the managers of collective farms, such as when farm workers woke up to see Bolshevik cadres hanging on the walls or thrown in the wheat fields, but the teams were strict in selecting their targets before doing so, and only those with deep grievances learned during the "grain trafficking" process were executed. Only then were they punished. Shukhevich believed that this was the way to change the stereotype of the "gangsters" and to show the general public that we were the righteous ones who had come to save the Ukrainian people from the clutches of the criminals! Of course this Robin Hood behavior won't last long, each attack will make the next one more difficult, and we can only hope for a thundering, lightning-fast, all-Ukrainian uprising sooner rather than later, before it develops into an uncontrollable vendetta."

According to the concept of "permanent revolution" put forward by Stepan Bandera, the head of propaganda of the Ukrainian nationalist organizations, together with Shukhovich, the head of infiltration operations, the Ukrainian national revolution must return the blood and violence to the Bolsheviks intact. But to do so would have made the insurgents "gangsters," and Shukhevich had to select a few disgruntled people to assassinate, and spend additional effort to inform the public about the authorities' genocidal attempts to "deliberately create a famine. Who would have thought that the insurgents would have to deliberately maintain the opposition between Ukrainians and Bolsheviks? Some of the more radical members even suggested that the opportunity should be taken to insert the anti-Semitic doctrine that by some logic it should be deduced that the managers of the kibbutzim were Jews who took orders from Moscow."

On closer inspection, it became clear how serious the situation was:there were nationalist associates in every division of the Ukrainian military district? And the so-called "Great Uprising" was to find a suitable moment to detonate the Dnepr hydroelectric power station at the inevitable outbreak of the Russian civil war? The rebels will first attack the Ukrainian military district headquarters and then take control of the city of Kiev, where the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile will return across the Bosnian-Soviet border to lead the rebel forces as planned, and a war no less than the one in 1919 will be repeated in this land!""

##Event - reunion
 ukr_reunion.1.t: "Néstor Makhno's revolution"
 ukr_reunion.1.d: "Néstor Makhno was undoubtedly the most unique warlord in the Ukrainian regional war of 1917-1922. He led the Black Army that fought successively against the White Army and the Red Army, while he himself and his followers worked to destroy all governments and establish an anarchist democratic society based on peasants and workers. Although their struggle ended in a total Bolshevik victory in Ukraine, the flame of anarchism was still not extinguished. With the severe famine brought about by the Soviet authorities' harsh collectivization and food collection policies in Ukraine since 1932, the Ukrainian peasant revolt against the Bolsheviks was rekindled, and anarchism re-entered the Ukrainian landscape as an alternative to Bolshevism. \n Anarchist activity in the Ukrainian region was mainly guerrilla. The Moscow authorities generally considered anarchist guerrillas to be no different from ordinary peasant rebellions, but the situation changed after Captain Buldrokkas'tee, an officer under Tukhachevsky, led a part of the troops to join the guerrillas. Anarchism was seen as a threat on a par with Ukrainian nationalist organizations, and this continued until the outbreak of the Second Ukrainian War of Independence. For the authorities in Moscow and the Ukrainian Soviet government in Kiev, the most notorious anarchist bandit was Yelena Frostnova, known as the "White Rabbit". \nAfter the outbreak of the Second Ukrainian War of Independence, Makhno also returned from exile in France to lead the anarchist revolution in Ukraine. Since the anarchists did not control the same areas as the nationalists, the two did not clash for the time being. With the fall of Petliura's government and the disappearance of Bandera, Makhno seized the power vacuum and, in one fell swoop, gathered a large number of Ukrainian rebels to join the Black Army. The time had come to belong to anarchism."
 ukr_reunion.1.a: "Bring death to those who oppress workers and peasants!"
 ukr_reunion.2.t: ""Patriot" Buldrokkas'tee"
 ukr_reunion.2.d: "A Jew born in a village east of Lviv, Buldrokkas'tee served with distinction in the Tsarist army during the last World War, rising to the rank of second lieutenant. at the time of the 1918 Revolution, Buldrokkas'tee followed General Tukhachevsky into the Soviet Red Army and fought in the 1920 Soviet-Polish War against the forces of Jozef Pilsudski and Maena Nearl. During the Battle of Warsaw in 1922, he was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal and promoted to the rank of captain for his service in covering the retreat of the main force. During the Tsarist period, Buldrokkas'tee's troops were known for their good military discipline, and after joining the Red Army he was widely praised. \n\nWith the end of the Soviet New Economic Policy and the widespread implementation of the collectivization policy, the idle units were mobilized again to suppress the peasant rebellion in the Ukraine, to search for OUN infiltrators and to combat anarchist guerrillas. However, in 1933. During a food collection mission for the collective farms on the Ukrainian border, Buldrokkas'tee discovered that his son, whom he had left behind for a year, had died of starvation in his home, and that the troops not under his command had only been collecting food from his son's home, not even bothering to bury it. Shocked and outraged, Buldrokkas'tee led a part of his inner circle to defect to the anarchist partisan forces in the southern Ukraine. Such a serious defection of an officer shocked Moscow. Kaganovich was then removed from his post. And the repressive activities against anarchism were put on the central agenda of the Kiev side. \n\nUnlike the local Ukrainian anarchists who hid their Ukrainian nationalist tendencies, the West Ukrainian-born Buldrokkas'tee was so devoted to his Russian homeland that he was jokingly called a "patriot". He joined the anarchist movement out of sympathy for the brutal conditions of the Ukrainian peasantry and out of anger at the atrocities committed by the Dzhugashvili authorities. During his guerrilla campaign in the south of Ukraine, he adopted Yelena Frostnova, a partisan from the now Romanian-occupied region of Moldova, as his adopted daughter, who became the most feared partisan "white rabbit" by the Kiev authorities. It is worth noting that, unlike many Jews who joined the left-wing movement, Buldrokkas'tee was also a Zionist sympathizer. He believed that Theresia's promise of a peaceful and democratic Jewish-Arab state would be fulfilled in the end."

 ukr_reunion.3.d: "As the Black Army seizes leadership of the Ukrainian Revolutionary War, the forces of opposition and sabotage against the Black Army's Gestapo Néstor Makhno are seizing the opportunity to undermine our revolution. The Bolsheviks and their intelligence agency, the NKVD, were pressing ahead with their assassination campaign against Makhno, and Ukrainian nationalist organizations were sparing no effort to unleash their brutal sabotage on the fellow Ukrainians they claimed to be protecting. Just when the Black Army was at the peak of its power for the first time and was caught up in the most tense of conflicts, bad news spread throughout Ukraine. Our dear old dad, Néstor Makhno, had been assassinated! [SOV.GetName], the Ukrainian nationalist organizations, and the Polish government all deny the assassination, no one knows who really did it, and we can only pray that the Black Army, as a decentralized resistance movement, will not fall into collapse."
 ukr_reunion.3.a: "Oh my God."     
 ukr_reunion.4.t: "Talula Artorius is elected as the new Black Army Hetman"
 ukr_reunion.4.d: "An emergency meeting of the Soviet of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies of Ukraine discussed the repercussions of the assassination of Makhno and how to deal with it. Since time was running out for a vote in the various local soviets, a simple emergency vote was taken by the soviet deputies still on standby in the Kiev suburbs. The result was that Talula Artorius, a deputy from the Kharkov region, won the vote and was elected as the new Black Army Gaitman. \n\nTalula Artorius was once the adopted daughter of a notorious old Russian nobleman, who ran away in anger because she could not stand the family's control over her and the cruel plundering of the poor peasants. During the Civil War in 1920, Artorius briefly joined the Bolsheviks and the Red Army, becoming a Bolshevik cadre in the local soviet in Kharkov, before being expelled for publicly criticizing Trotsky in the newspapers. Artorius then led some of her loyal cadres to join the Black Army under Makhno, and in the 1921 offensive against the White Army led by Peter Wrangel showed great leadership skills and charisma, and was widely praised by the local peasants. In Finland in 1930, she met Yelena Frostnova, a former comrade who was ready to return to the Ukraine first to start the resistance, and Alina, the editor of a local left-wing newspaper, and the three formed a friendship. \n\nWith the outbreak of the Ukrainian War of Independence again, Artorius and Makhno and others returned to Ukraine in succession to try to re-establish the Black Army. After the fall of Petliura's regime, Artorius gave a very successful speech in Kiev and persuaded some of the officers loyal to Petliura to join the Black Army. This greatly increased her prestige. Today, Talula Artorius has been elected as the new Gestapo of the Black Army and has become the new Batko ("Father") among many Ukrainian peasants. Talula Artorius was a little uncomfortable after being called "Papa," but she was ready to lead the whole anarchist movement to victory."

 ukr_reunion.5.t: "Alina arrives in Odessa"
 ukr_reunion.5.d: "Talula Artorius' best friend, Alina, was a former media editor of an underground left-wing newspaper in the Finnish region, working as a covert propagandist against the government until the democratization of the Finnish government, and has inextricable ties to the Soviet side. During Talula Artorius' exile in Finland, she befriended Talula and Yelena Frostnova and turned to anarchism. It was Alina who gave Talula Artorius firm moral support when she was at her most disillusioned. With the Black Army taking the leadership of the Ukrainian War of Independence, Alina decided to leave for Ukraine to support the cause of her closest friend. This was the first time that her ideals would be put into practice. Alina herself had no experience in armed struggle, but our revolution itself required a lot of work to help refugees and rebuild society, and Alina would be a great help in that regard. On the ship to Odessa, Alina is already talking to our pickups about establishing a school for the common good."
 ukr_reunion.5.a: "Sister, welcome!" 
 ukr_reunion.6.t: "The anti-Semitic atrocities of the Ukrainian army"
 ukr_reunion.6.d: "Despite Simon Petliura's claim that "the enemy of the Jews is the enemy of Ukraine," he did not have any interest in disciplining the officers under his command. For a long time, Jews were considered natural allies of the Bolsheviks because of the "Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy theory" that prevailed in the Western world. And because of the influence of old religious theology, many conservative officers also saw Jews as the enemy. As a result, repression and even massacres of Jews began to take place everywhere since the outbreak of the Ukrainian War of Independence. Despite the fact that after the fall of Petliura's regime a large number of troops fell to the Black Army and some of them had no intention of joining it, anti-Semitic activities were still prevalent everywhere. Despite the fact that Talula Artorius came to power and put out the fires, anti-Semitic activities continued. During a mission to rescue Jewish refugees, Talula's own troops searched a village based on intelligence and found that the village people had assisted the former Petliura army stationed there in inhumanely torturing Jews seeking food by starving them alive while locked in empty barns. It appears that these people gave the starvation brought about by the failed Bolshevik policy to their imaginary Bolshevik agents, the Jews. \nTalula was extremely angry after witnessing this atrocity, and the dream of creating a society where all peoples lived in harmony was mercilessly humiliated right before his eyes ......"

 ukr_reunion.7.t: "Leonid BrezhnevCaptured alive"
 ukr_reunion.7.d: "Since the imposition of the collectivization policy by Joseph Dzhugashvili, the famine in the Ukrainian region began to expand at a visible rate. Despite the removal of Kaganovich, who was in charge of collecting grain, in 1932 due to the defection of Buldrokkas'tee, the imposed collectivization and food collection system still did not provide substantial relief. Moscow claimed to destroy the "Kulak" by collecting from the Ukrainian peasants, but the officials who came to collect were often richer than the richest "Kulak" in the region. This was represented by Leonid Brezhnev and his "Dnepr gang". Brezhnev, working as a deputy under Khrushchev, was keen to use forceful methods to seize grain and claim credit from Moscow, while at the same time he and his colleagues accumulated a lot of wealth during the collectivization process and stocked up on caviar in his family's warehouses. \n This bastard has now fallen into our hands. Brezhnev now cries and cries on his knees in front of Talula, claiming that it was all Jugashvili's fault and that he was only carrying out orders. buldrokkas'tee suggested that he be imprisoned or reformed through labor, but Talula seems to be even more indignant about Brezhnev's behavior."

 ukr_reunion.7.b: ""I'll shoot him myself!"" 
 ukr_reunion.8.t: "The Death of Alina"
 ukr_reunion.8.d: "Although Talula Artorius was a charismatic leader, in order to uphold the principles of anarchism since Makhno, she had always insisted on taking in as many armed forces as possible while being tolerant of divisions and factionalism within the movement. Tallulah and Bodrokasti disagreed on whether to leave the Western Ukraine to accept more armed peasants, and Bodrokasti resented Tallulah's practice of releasing a group of local militiamen who did not want to continue the struggle and distributing large amounts of supplies to them. \Tallulah soon paid the price for her decision. While resupplying in the western Dnieper, Tallulah's immediate forces drove out a group of local militiamen who had unsuccessfully tried to fight for food, and then repelled a small group of Ukrainian nationalist organizations. However, Tallulah found that Alina, who was with her as she prepared to cross the Dnieper River, had been plundered and killed by the militia she had just let go in exchange for supplies in the next village. The marauders even cut off Alina's arm to take the basket and took the plain silver ring that Tallulah had given to Alina. \n Before she broke off, Alina broke off and explained to Tallulah that all this was not her fault, that she was on the right track, and not to be blinded by hatred and fear. Alina finally asks Yelena Frostnova to take her place in the supervision of Talula Artorius."

 ukr_reunion.8.b: ""Alina, there is no one to replace you. Not ever!"" 
 ukr_reunion.9.t: "Reunion Soviet Congress"
 ukr_reunion.9.d: "With Reunion's leadership in the revolutionary war throughout Ukraine established, it was time to convene a congress of Reunion soviets in the Ukrainian regions in accordance with Néstor Makhno's vision and Talula Artorius' plan. Talula Artorius gave an infectious speech and Yelena Frostnova presided over the agenda. However, there were still many discordant voices. A number of local trade union representatives, especially those of industrial workers, were very uncomfortable with our ideas and ideals, and they seemed to prefer the Social Democratic Labor Party of Ukraine. These discordant voices were quickly countered by the representatives of the railroad workers' soviet, but still set off a firestorm of controversy. Many trade union representatives and some peasant leaders, who were also members of the Social Democratic Labor Party and the former Social Revolutionary Party, demanded that we restore the Central Rada, have nationwide representative universal suffrage, and stop the unchaptered redistribution until legislation was passed. \nThese blatant demands for the restoration of bourgeois democracy will naturally not be treated well by us. With an order from Talula Artorius, the remnants of Petliura's followers were blown out of the room by the cadres of the Reunion."
 ukr_reunion.9.a: "Spokesmen of the old order, get out!"
 ukr_reunion.10.t: "Search for social democrats"
 ukr_reunion.10.d: "Talula Artorius has always been respected by all sides for her tolerance of sectarianism and amazing leadership. But since the Soviet Congress, Talula Artorius has become agitated and suspicious, most likely as a consequence of the multiple mental stresses represented by Alina's death since the outbreak of the war. She could no longer tolerate any further challenges to her authority, especially when a group of social democrats openly opposed her revolutionary plans at the Soviet Congress. She demanded that Reunion carry out a complete "revolutionary repression" of these "counter-revolutionaries, bourgeois politicians and Bolshevik saboteurs". It is clear that the Social Democratic Labor Party and Reunion itself have been entangled since the fall of the Petliura regime and the mass defection of its personnel. The liquidation of the Social Democratic Labor Party would undoubtedly require another "revolution" against many urban unions and a considerable number of agricultural cooperatives, and a considerable number of union leaders and village council representatives would have to be implicated."
 ukr_reunion.10.a: "Death to all counter-revolutionaries!"
 ukr_reunion.10.b: "Yelena Frostnova stopped this atrocity."
 ukr_reunion.11.t: "The Evolution of the Revolution"
 ukr_reunion.11.d: "Ever since the Black Army was founded and confronted the White and Red armies, criticism has been directed at the Black Army. It has been argued that the anarchist organization was ultimately no different from the average warlord, except that the Military Revolutionary Committee was controlling power in a more secretive way. To some extent, these criticisms have been valid, especially since the Black Army grew and Reunion was founded. But these criticisms were soon weakened by Reunion's purge of internal social democrats, as Reunion itself moved toward a state of informal violence and terror as an alternative to state violence. Obviously, at least in terms of results, this was very different from what Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Makhno had envisioned, but it seemed so natural that the slow-witted could not detect it for a moment. In any case, Reunion has now become Talula Artorius' machine for revolutionary terror, fueled by hatred of the rebels. For Talula, she could not tolerate any more obstacles on the road to her utopia, all enemies, factionalists, Bolsheviks, Moscow and Warsaw, they all had to be destroyed."
 ukr_reunion.11.a: "Long live Talula!"
 ukr_reunion.12.t: "Conflict"
 ukr_reunion.12.d: ""Let me repeat, my claim is clear. Our operational bottleneck is undoubtedly the Dnieper River. As soon as we cross the Dnieper, the Soviet line will not be so strong. the Reunion flag must cross the Dnieper, it must fly over Kharkiv, and we must even drive the Bolsheviks out of Donbass. "Talula Artorius was no longer prepared to give Bodrokasti any room for rebuttal, but the young woman was still wary of facing the battle-hardened veteran, a brilliant orator and an inspiring leader, but she had not served under Makhno for so long. Bozokasti, on the other hand, was a commander who had fought outside Warsaw, in Lviv, and in the Crimea. \n \n "Miss Artorius, I understand your ambition to bring more people into the free zone and your urgent need to expand your ranks. But I, as a professional military man, have claims that I must uphold. I do not believe that our forces are sufficient to enable us to advance into the Donbass, especially since you continue to give away supplies that could have fed our soldiers to the units that broke away from the Black Army." The old codger always wore a black helmet that made it impossible to see what expression he was wearing, but everyone in the command had caught a whiff of sharp conflict. \n\nTalula became a little agitated. Frostnova sat on a makeshift bench in command staring at the map without saying a word, but her eyes were clearly not on the Dnieper, nor on the Donbass. Néstor Makhno had not said anything about turning the entire Ukraine into a free area, but it was clear that the Black Army was predominantly ethnic Ukrainian and predominantly Ukrainian-speaking, and liberating the entire Ukraine was the natural choice. But would the Russian-speaking regions of eastern Ukraine welcome her, Talula herself had no idea, but she felt she always had to try." With all due respect, I have to wonder if you are questioning my leadership skills or are losing faith in our cause. You know how Moscow has treated the people of the Ukrainian region for the last five years, and they will do the same thing if we give up Kharkov and Donbass. You know this better than I do, Mr. Bozokasti, after having dealt with the Russians for so long. Or should I call you by your elegant name, 'Patriot'?" \n\nThe word "Russian" had already raised the tension in the room, and Talula's naming of "patriot" added fuel to the fire. Yes, the Black Army is a team with internationalist ideals, and Reunion is an internationalist movement. Many officers and soldiers of Reunion hide their Ukrainian nationalism, and some of those who are attached to the Russian motherland are not aware of it, Talula and Bozokasti are just a few of them. Maybe Reunion can really keep its own undertones, or maybe Talula and Petliura are not so different in the first place. Fortunately, these conflicts were just an episode in the war with the Bolsheviks, albeit a somewhat worrisome one ......"

Since the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, they have been able to spend less and less time together as father and daughter." Father, I can't figure out why you're so appreciative of that Theresia. It's one thing to speak up for the Jews, it's another thing to move them to Palestine to build a state. And that Austrian legacy, Kelsch, her obscure writing seems ridiculous to me. In some ways she's not even as good as Alfred Rosenberg ......" \n \n Bodrokasti was still wearing his black helmet, but couldn't hide the fact that he was a bit agitated, "Yelena, Speaker Theresia has promised to create a democratic state where all peoples are equal. I know she's not like us, and our definition of socialism may be different, but she's more capable and insightful than you think. Now Bund has also changed her position and supports her Babel Program ......" \n\\n "In the end it's still colonization ......" \n\n "Everywhere the Jews go now is colonization!" Buldrokkas'tee interrupted Frostnova, his voice becoming loud, but shaky." Yelena, you don't understand, you don't understand what it's like for an oppressed people to be without a homeland for centuries! Israel is not my homeland, my homeland is the great Russia. But I can feel my fellow countrymen their situation, their pain. I believe in the future of Israel, just as I believe in the future of Russia." \n\nThe night was only silent except for the crackling of the fire. Inez and W sat side by side behind a large rock quietly eavesdropping on their conversation, W lighting a cigarette as they both fell silent. They had both been members of the Bund before they joined Reunion, and the same arguments and divisions had occurred within the Bund. Everything seemed to be a dilemma, even the moonlight seemed to mock the fate of the Eastern European Jews."

 ukr_reunion.14.d: "When it comes to the old Tsarist Russia and the Romanovs in the Ukrainian region, it's safe to say that almost everyone except those old-school Cossacks cries foul. But an interesting rumor is starting to make things interesting. According to Chita's claims, Anastasia Romanova, the rightful heir with the Romanov family, has been crowned as the new Tsar in Chita. However, this rumor claims that the tsarina in Chita is a fake. The real tsarina is no other than Yelena Frostnova, the core cadre of Reunion. After all, according to the official portrait, Anastasia is a white-haired woman with bangs covering one eye, and is often associated with winter, ice and snow. All of the above features match Frostnova very closely, except for the rabbit-ear headdress that Frostnova wore to mock the Bolshevik snipers. The irony of this rumor, however, is that Anastasia is a representative of the authoritarianism of the old empire, while Frostnova is an anarchist revolutionary. \The message eventually reached Frostnova's ears, and the Reunion cadres didn't take it seriously - after all, there were rumors that Talula was a puppet of the old Russian aristocracy, and when Frostnova heard the rumor, she prodded a mouthful of spittle into the fireplace."Me?

Anastasia crossed the armored car escorting her in front of her, and with a steady pace went up to help the old Cossack who had stumbled and dismounted and trotted over. \n\nA long time ago, before the Great War broke out, as a loyal defender of the Russian Empire, Pavel Skoropatsky had served as an attendant to Tsar Nicholas II. He was highly appreciated and was quickly promoted during the Great War, commanding troops from a regiment to a division to a lieutenant general commanding the Ukrainian Cavalry Army until the disastrous year 1917. After that the German army moved in, the Central Rada was disbanded, the Ukrainian state was formed, and the Great War ended with the collapse of the earth... It has been a full twenty years so far. \n\n "Uncle Pavel? How are you?" \n\n "Ah!"

 ukr.10.t: "Composition of the Ukrainian Independence Army"
 ukr.10.d: "Just like the hastily formed ranks that rebelled against Tsarist Russia and the Bolshevik revolutionaries twenty years earlier, the Ukrainian rebels, who had seized upon the failed policy of Dzhugashvili, were still a rabble of soldiers from all walks of life. The Ukrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party and the Ukrainian Social-Revolutionary Party were consolidated under the leadership of Simon Petliura, and after the defeat of the First War of Independence the remnants went into exile in France. Some members of the Ukrainian Social Revolutionary Party joined the Bolsheviks, but most of them were imprisoned during the first purges against the Ukrainian regional communist parties in 1932-1934. As Britain, France, and the United States ignored the demands of Ukrainian exiles for independence and the complaints of famine in Ukraine, some generals loyal to Simon Petliura began contacts with the newly emerging Germany after their exile. The most enthusiastic German advocate of Ukrainian independence was undoubtedly Alfred Rosenberg, a leading theoretician of the German People's Party, who first contacted Simon Petliura in Paris in 1934.\nThe radical right wing, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), led by Yevhen Konovalets, chose instead to launch a campaign of resistance and sabotage against the Polish occupiers in the Polish-occupied regions of Galicia and Volynia. As the Polish government became increasingly authoritarian, repression against ethnic Ukrainians intensified, just as the OUN had hoped, and in 1934, the OUN's newest leader, Stepan Bandera, shocked all of Europe by organizing the successful assassination of Polish Interior Minister Bronisław Piełacki. Beginning in 1935, the Polish government began to systematically drive OUN-trained militias into Soviet territory and to take in Ukrainian peasants who had fled to Poland because of hunger. Through this series of actions, the Polish government successfully used the failure of Soviet policy in Ukraine to induce Ukrainian nationalists to turn against the Soviet Union.\nDespite widespread repression, the conservative old Cossack groups still had some influence among Ukrainian peasants. The former Habsburg Vasyl Vyshvany led this conservative force. His ally, the former Gaitman Pavel Skoropatsky, had collaborated with the invaders of the German Empire to expel the Russian Empire and Bolshevik influence. Nevertheless, the conservatives led by Skoropatsky maintained their ties with the Imperial Russian government in Chita. Unlike Skoropatsky, Vyshvany had his own intentions regarding Ukraine.\nThere was also a most unusual resistance force, the anarchist Black Army led by Néstor Makhno. The anarchists had allied themselves with the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War, but then clashed with them to the point where they were finally annihilated. Makhno himself went into exile in France, where he joined other socialists in their struggle against the restored Bourbon government. Dzhugashvili's brutal policy and failed repression in Ukraine led to a resurgence of anarchism among the peasantry, and a former Red Army officer under General Tukhachevsky, Buldrokas'tee, joined the anarchist partisans directly. This time, anarchists and nationalists seemed to be temporary allies in the fight against the Bolsheviks, but there was no doubt that they would eventually come to confront each other. Only one conception of Ukraine would triumph."
 ukr.10.a: "Can we succeed this time?"

 ukr.11.t: "Assassination attempt of Yevhen Konovalets"
 ukr.11.d: "Yevhen Konovalets, the founder of the Ukrainian Nationalist Organization (OUN), was a thorn in the side of the Polish government in Warsaw, the Soviet government in Moscow, and the Russian imperial government in Chita. Yevhen Konovalets had seized an army of Ukrainians from the old Austrian Empire in 1918 to support Simon Petliura, and went into exile after the failure of Ukrainian independence. In its program, the OUN proclaimed that it would \"enslave other nations for the freedom of Ukraine\"; in its actions, it often resorted to terrorism in its confrontation with Poland and the Soviet Union. In its actions, the OUN often resorted to terrorist methods in its confrontation with Poland and the Soviet Union, such as assassination of dignitaries, destruction of facilities, and assassination of Ukrainians who tried to cooperate with the authorities, in order to provoke conflicts between them. These acts were undoubtedly hated by Warsaw, Moscow and Chita.\n\nAs Simon Petliura returned to Ukraine to take part in the uprising against Moscow, Konovalets also came to Ukraine to join the fight by organizing the OUN militia. Konovalets' alliance with Petliura was temporary, but solid, at least for this short period of time. This was also clear on the part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet intelligence agency NKVD had previously developed numerous assassination plans against Konovalets. Today, Konovalets arrived at the Kyiv station, where an NKVD agent disguised as a delivery man presented him with a box of cakes sent to him by his friend, which was a carefully disguised bomb."

The sewn-up Ukrainian resistance will soon be plunged into spoils-sharing infighting.\n\nBut as long as the alliance between Petliura and Konovalets does not split, this will not happen either. Yet the fundamental philosophical conflict between the two is simply too great, and continued cooperation will only make their respective ideals unattainable in compromise.\n\nHowever, more than a decade ago, it was the former Austro-Hungarian Army \"Sechi Riflemen\" led by Konovalets that provided Petliura with the crucial force that enabled the latter to ascend to the position of head of the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic. So why not continue the cooperation? It's all for Ukraine."

 ukr.16.d: "The death of the young and powerful Konovalets led to a confrontation between the old and the young in the OUN he had created. Melnik, the old comrade with the will in hand, was soon ousted by the young radical Stepan Bandera, whose reputation among his peers was so high that it was only logical that he should take over the leadership. However, Bandera himself was extremely violent and had already turned the tables on the \"old guys\", who had ceded territories to the Poles in the past and were guilty of unforgivable acts. Now that the only former leader who could stabilize the situation is gone, there is no one left to stop him from carrying out his radical plans."

 ukr.18.d: "As a result of the armed conflict between Simon Petliura and Stepan Bandera, the command center of the Ukrainian resistance has been completely destroyed. The main resistance forces in the entire Ukrainian region are now unorganized, and some of the remaining OUN members have tried to take over the temporary office building in Kiev, but the building is also empty and in disarray. At that moment, the head of the anarchist military forces, Néstor Makhno, spoke to Ukraine's temporary radio station and called on the resistance to join him in the fight for a free and equal Ukraine. Some hard-line nationalists refused to obey Makhno, but many officers chose to join Makhno's forces. In this conflict, the anarchists won the final victory, but it remained an open question whether the anarchists could defeat the Bolsheviks."

The Bourbon royal family ordered the deportation of Petliura and his party eventually for the French public are surprisingly sympathetic to the killer.\n\nThe OUN had been a terrorist organisation since its inception, and to throw the blame on the dead Konovalets and Bandera would have been a good way to clear the name of the current regime."

However, Skoropadskyi's past as head of the German puppet regime did not give him the chance to take part in current politics, so the German aristocrat Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, the spiritual Ukrainian Vasyl Vyshyvany, occupied this ecological position. The ambition of Vyshyvany to become king of Ukraine was an open secret, due to his Habsburg aristocratic culture, and he had good personal relations with both former Austro-Hungarian officers in Western Ukraine and Cossack leaders in Eastern Ukraine.
