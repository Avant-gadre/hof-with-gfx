##Equip-land
 POR_infantry_equipment_0: "Espingarda 6,5 mm m/1904"
 POR_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser-Vergueiro"
 POR_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "A bolt action rifle with a long history of service, the 6,5 mm m/1904 is more commonly known by the moniker of 'Mauser-Vergueiro', as the main design of the gun is essentially that of the Mauser 98 (with a special bolt action mechanism heavily based on the Gewehr 1888) with the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro cartridge, one developed specifically for the portuguese variant. It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."
 POR_infantry_equipment_1: "Espingarda 7.92 mm m/1904/36 "
 POR_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser-Vergueiro M36"
 POR_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Fundamentally little more than an updated version of the Mauser-Vergueiro to work with different sets of ammunition, it was introduced to Africa amid rising tensions between Portugal and Germany, and it became associated with Portugal's heavy handed reprisals in those areas. Its usage in Europe, while less famous, was far more widespread, but it was utterly supplanted by the FBP on later years."
 POR_infantry_equipment_2: "Carabina C.A.P Modelo 01"
 POR_infantry_equipment_2_short: "C.A.P M40"
 POR_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "A prototype carbine that saw little widespread use in Portugal's army as a whole was the country's first attempt at a standard issue, nationally produced design. As such, the nationalist Integralist junta supported the development of the C.A.P carbine intensely, but by the time it was ready for production, realities on the ground made it more worthwhile to switch to the FBP overall directly from the older Mauser-Vergueiro and variants already widely in use by the armed forces."
 POR_infantry_equipment_3: "Pistola-Metralhadora FBP M/945"
 POR_infantry_equipment_3_short: "FBP M/945"
 POR_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The FBP submachine gun is named after the acronym for the Braço de Prata Factory, the manufacturer for the weapon, a foundry owned and controlled by the Portuguese government itself. While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg."
 POR_support_weapons: "Metralhadora Vickers & Morteiro Stokes"

During its rearmament after the conflict, the restored Portuguese monarchy purchased and fabricated them with the intention of widespread use among infantry both at home and overseas."
 POR_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora Lewis Modelo DEMS & Morteiro SBML de 2 Polegadas"
 POR_support_weapons_2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis served the Entente since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. The MKIII variant had a pistol grip that allowed it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML, while small, is incredibly portable and had greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 POR_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Vickers Modelo II & Morteiro ML de 3 Polegadas"
 POR_support_weapons_3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG featured a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It had been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar was a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it was reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 POR_support_weapons4: "Metralhadora Vickers-Vedras & Morteiro de 4.2 Polegadas"
 POR_support_weapons_4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar was a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 POR_infantry_at: "Morteiro-Bombarda"
 POR_infantry_at_desc: "Developed in Canada and sold in substantial amounts to Portugal, the mortar design was that of a 'spigot' mortar. Arguing that the design could serve as both an artillery piece and an anti-tank weapon, the design was eagerly adopted by several allies of the Entente, including Portugal."
 POR_infantry_at2: "LATI"
 POR_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the LATI (A direct translation of its Canadian English name) was developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device was well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there were concerns about its intense recoil."
