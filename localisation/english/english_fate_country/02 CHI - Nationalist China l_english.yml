 wtt_china.3.desc: "[From.GetLeader] has returned our note, claiming that the Central Government has no legal authority to replace a provincial governor. It was accompanied by a detailed report stating the combat-readiness of his troops."
 wtt_china.3.a: "We will see about that."
 wtt_china.10.t: "China Demands Subjugation"
 wtt_china.10.desc: "The government of [From.GetLeader] has sent a fiery message, noting a number of policy decisions we have made over the last few months, which they consider to run counter to the national interests of [From.GetNameDef]. Unless we align our policies more closely with the [From.GetAdjective] government, they will take \"such measures as they deem necessary.\""
 wtt_china.10.a: "We have no choice."
 wtt_china.10.b: "We will fight!"
 wtt_china.11.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Submits"
 wtt_china.11.desc: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has responded to our note and promised to consult us in all further decisions. Our ambassador to [From.GetNameDef] has been promoted to Special Representative and has been tasked with ensuring the [From.GetAdjective] don't stray too far."
 wtt_china.11.a: "Great!"
 wtt_china.12.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Defiant"
 wtt_china.12.desc: "Our diplomatic note to [From.GetNameDef] has apparently been leaked to the press, which is now in an uproar. Even the international news papers have written very unfavorable editorials, calling our reasonable requests of consultation \"meddling in internal affairs\", \"a dangerous precedent\" and even \"naked imperialism\". \n\nNeedless to say, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to discuss the matter any further and has indicated that bringing it up again would lead to suspension of diplomatic contacts entirely."

 wtt_infiltration.4.t: "Communist Infiltration defeated?"
 wtt_infiltration.4.desc: "Reports of a wide-spread communist infiltration seems to have been grossly exaggerated. Raids on a number of known hideouts and communist activists have turned up nothing. This either means that the Communists have been unable to organize any cells, or that we have crushed the ones they managed to create. We must remain vigilant, however, as they will no doubt try to lull us in a sense of security before begining their efforts anew."

 wtt_china_shared.3.desc: "In a stern note, [From.GetLeader] has informed us that his government would not tolerate any interference with internal [From.GetAdjective] matters.

Outnumbered and outgunned by their opponents, they have fought gallantly to contest the skies over China. \n\nDespite the bravery of their pilots, the [From.GetAdjective] Air Force is desperately searching for new planes and pilots to replace its losses.

 wtt_china_shared.11.desc_b: "With the war in China continuing, the [From.GetAdjective] Air Force has been stretched thin trying to defend the airspace over [From.GetNameDef] and provide air support for the fighting troops.

 CHI_infantry_equipment_0: "MinGan Type 88"
 CHI_infantry_equipment_0_short: "MinGan Type 88"
 CHI_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Originally a product of late Guangxu era 'Self Strengthening' efforts, the Type 88 was designed as a close copy of the German Gewehr 88 with export modifications. While collectively inferior to newer rifles despite improvements, and often poorly maintained, the weapon is known to be rugged and reliable if unwieldy.\n\nThis variety is produced in the small workshops of the Mingan Insurgent Zone, though equipment shortages and personal preference often see it used alongside a wide variety of other weapons such as the Daodao."
 CHI_infantry_equipment_1: "Huadong Type 27"
 CHI_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Huadong Type 27"
 CHI_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Originally called the 'Xuantong Type 27', this rifle was put into Qing service in 1935 through German assistance after the Restoration. The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nFirst produced at the Hanyang arsenal with German tools, manufacturing methods have already spread to KMT-held areas, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."
 CHI_infantry_equipment_2: "Tsingtao MP18"
 CHI_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Tsingtao MP18"
 CHI_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Thanks to the flood of Weltkrieg surplus into the world market in the early 1920s, the MP18 saw action in China some time before a modified version began production in Tsingtao.\n\nWith changes to the magazine and stock, this particular product of Sino-German cooperation has been copied and sold throughout Northern and Southern China, though primarily to the Qing Government."
 CHI_infantry_equipment_3: "Zhongshan Xinhai Type 33"
 CHI_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zhongshan Type 33"
 CHI_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Type 33 is a semi-automatic rifle based on the General Liu rifle from 1914. While appearing similar, the Type 33 is shorter, has the rear of the receiver covered, and the gas-trap system replaced by a simple gas port. The new rifle is also no longer able to switch to manual action and uses magazines from the Bohemian ZH-29 rifle and ZB-26 light machine gun."

 CHI_support_weapons: "Nanjing 8mm light machine gun & Jingling Xuantong Type 23 82mm mortar"
 CHI_support_weapons2: "Hanyang 30 festival 7.9mm machine gun 'Old yellow ox' & Pajiang Xuantong Type 32 150mm mortar"
 CHI_support_weapons3: "Xuantong Type 27 heavy machine gun & Pajiang Xuantong Type 34 60mm mortar"

 CHI_artillery_equipment_1: "75mm Hanyang Xinhai Type 10 Field Gun"
 CHI_artillery_equipment_1_short: "75mm Hanyang Type 10"
 CHI_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "As the most produced artillery during the Beiyang government of the Republic of China, this artillery entered service in various armies across China.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Qing government announced that it would be renamed 'Xuantong Type 13' after the Qing restoration. But other republican forces still call it as the 'Xinhai Type 10'."
 CHI_artillery_equipment_2: "75mm Pajiang Xinhai Type 25 Howitzer"
 CHI_artillery_equipment_2_short: "75mm Pajiang Type 25"

 CHI_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "20mm Pajiang M1939 Gun"

 CHI_anti_tank_equipment_1: "37mm Hanyang Xinhai Type 18 Flat Trajectory Gun"
 CHI_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "37mm Hanyang Type 18"
 CHI_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Although this is actually the '37mm Hanyang Type 21' commonly equipped by the Qing army, some ardent republicans instead call it the Xinhai Type 18 according to the Republic of China's Xinhai calendar."
 CHI_anti_tank_equipment_2: "37mm Pajiang Xinhai Type 30 Anti-tank Gun"
 CHI_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "37mm Pajiang Type 30"

 CHI_gw_armored_car_equipment: "Shanghai Type 1929"
 CHI_gw_armored_car_equipment_short: "Type 1929"
 CHI_gw_armored_car_equipment_desc: "'1929' isn't the exact code name, but rather the production date of these armoured cars. In fact, they do not have any official code name at all. The vehicle is equipped with two 30-festival machine guns and six shooting holes for the crew.\n\nIn order to reverse the situation of the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang commissioned the arsenal in Shanghai concession in March 1928 to manufacture these armoured vehicles. Unfortunately, when these armoured vehicles left the arsenal, the KMT had been completely defeated. Therefore only three original vehicles were ever produced."
 CHI_armored_car_equipment_1: "Shanghai Type 1930"
 CHI_armored_car_equipment_1_short: "Type 1930"
 CHI_armored_car_equipment_1_desc: "Similar to its predecessors, the Shanghai Type 1930 was also ordered by the KMT Central Committee from factories in the Shanghai concession. Two prototypes were first built, which had no actual combat record.\n\nThe armoured vehicle weighs five tons, and bears a rotatable turret with a heavy machine gun and a light machine gun."
 CHI_armored_car_equipment_2: "Shanghai Xinhai Type 36 'Fukong Baolei'"
 CHI_armored_car_equipment_2_short: "Type 36 'Fukong Baolei'"
 CHI_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "As an armoured vehicle independently designed by the Kuomintang army, the Xinhai Type 36 armoured car embodies the peak of the development of the Kuomintang armoured vehicle.\n\nThe armoured vehicle has ten wheels and can adapt to a variety of terrain. Due to its external armour, its wheels are mostly concealed, which can make this car appear to float. Therefore, it earned the nickname 'Fukong Baolei' or 'Floating Fortress'."

##Equipment-tank
 CHI_motorized_equipment_1: "Type Xinzhong 'New China'"
 CHI_motorized_equipment_1_short: "Xinzhong"
 CHI_motorized_equipment_1_desc: "Through the efforts of a group of Chinese engineers headed by Zhi Bingyuan, combined with the many advantages of German-made trucks, the Kuomintang built the Type Xinzhong with domestically produced parts in the MinGan base at Longyan. Its gearbox, transmission, and steering mechanism are all made in China and can adapt to China's mountainous terrain. Its designer Zhi Bingyuan named it 'Xinzhong', which means 'New China'."

 CHI_mechanized_equipment_1: "Renault UE Chenillette"
 CHI_mechanized_equipment_1_short: "Renault UE"
 CHI_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "During his exile in France, Dai Anlan of the National Revolutionary Army learned some theories about mechanised warfare from the French. When he returned to China, at his request, the French handed him a batch of retired Renault UE along with the design drawings. Dai Anlan believed that he could use this equipment to form China's first mechanised force."
