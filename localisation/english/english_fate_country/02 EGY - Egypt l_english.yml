##Focus
 egyptian_focus: "Egyptian National Focus"
 EGY_modernization_program: "Modernisation Programme"
 EGY_modernization_program_desc: "The extremely weak nature of the Egyptian industrial economy requires our attention, through a programme of subsidies and state-sponsored businesses we can bring industrialisation to Egypt and become a truly modern country."
 EGY_new_economy: "New Economy"
 EGY_new_economy_desc: "In just a few short years Egypt's economy has begun to turn around, far from being a backwards agricultural nation she now enjoys a strong industrial base, institutions of higher education and a modern transport system. Whatever else may be, nobody can accuse the New Sultanate of being behind the times."
 EGY_egyptian_airports: "Egyptian Airports"
 EGY_egyptian_airports_desc: "Aviation is more of a prestige project for us currently, showing Egypt to be the leading light of the Middle East in technical innovation. By constructing new airports with the help of European experts we can reinforce this notion and work towards a commercially viable aviation industry."
 EGY_blue_nile_dams: "Blue Nile Dams"
 EGY_blue_nile_dams_desc: "Damming the White Nile was politically easy, given that over 90% of it lies within our realm. However the Blue Nile has presented a harder challenge, as much of it lies within the sometimes hostile nation of Ethiopia. We have resolved to press ahead with the project however and bring electrification to most of Sudan."
 EGY_egyptian_radio: "Egyptian Radio"
 EGY_egyptian_radio_desc: "[EGY.GetLeader]'s coronation speech was the first nationwide royal broadcast in Egyptian history, bringing the masses closer to their king than many of them could have dreamed. Now by investing in our communications infrastructure the whole nation may hear [EGY.GetLeader]'s voice! The music is also popular."
 EGY_develop_electrics: "Develop Electrics"
 EGY_develop_electrics_desc: "A new age of computers is dawning upon us - we must explore what it represents and how it can benefit us."
 EGY_egyptian_cinema: "Hollywood On The Nile"
 EGY_egyptian_cinema_desc: "Our burgeoning middle class has shown a great appetite for the cinema and for the state it presents an untapped industry. Egypt is a sunny country with striking landscapes suitable for filming in, and as such large tax breaks should bring film companies flocking to our shores."
 EGY_military_factories: "Electrification Programme"
 EGY_military_factories_desc: "Electricity in Egypt is entirely under the control of private companies, and as such there is very little standardisation of voltage and outlets. By introducing the Egyptian Electrical Authority we can bring electricity to rural areas as well as enforcing nation-wide standards."
 EGY_military_improvements: "Military Investments"
 EGY_military_improvements_desc: "One of the easiest areas in which we can expand out industry is in arms production, over which we have a great deal of direct influence. Encouraging the domestic production of licensed German firearms will not only support the economy but arm the nation."
 EGY_new_universities: "New Universities"
 EGY_new_universities_desc: "It is not enough simply to rely on foreign experts to run our businesses. The creation of several new Austrian-style institutes of technology and research universities that will teach not just the liberal arts but physics, chemical engineering and nuclear science will greatly expand the knowledge base of our nation and provide skilled workers for modern industries."
 EGY_cairo_institute_of_arms: "German Investment"
 EGY_cairo_institute_of_arms_desc: "Mauser and Walther, these names are a byword for quality armaments the world over. Now prestigious German firms are seeking to establish factories in Egypt and buy government arms contracts, we see no reason to prevent them."
 EGY_egyptian_steel: "Egyptian Steel"
 EGY_egyptian_steel_desc: "Commensurate with our new commitment to technical education comes a need to invest in a broader resource base. Rather than shipping ore abroad we intend to set up rolling mills in Port Said to produce Egyptian Steel for domestic use."

 EGY_railroad_expansion_desc: "Transportation is a vital part of our programme, and while previously our railroads had been purely built for the purposes of transporting goods to ports for export we intend to make the network much denser and provide for transportation between settlements for internal movement of goods and people."
 EGY_red_sea_trade: "Red Sea Trade"
 EGY_red_sea_trade_desc: "The Red Sea is a large trade up for the region. Should we expand our ports there, the Arab communities will have unprecedented growth!"
 EGY_civilian_investments: "Civilian Investments"
 EGY_civilian_investments_desc: "While the private sector has been encouraged by our investments we must go further, and found some entirely state-owned enterprises to produce vital goods for our industry."
 EGY_modernized_agriculture: "Modernised Agriculture"
 EGY_modernized_agriculture_desc: "The tractor is a wondrous invention that could revolutionise agriculture on the banks of the Nile. By supporting the mechanisation of farming we can not only vastly increase output but also increase migration to towns and cities, supporting industry."
 EGY_egyptian_oil: "Egyptian Oil"
 EGY_egyptian_oil_desc: "Egypt has rich oil resources, if we could only exploit them. Foreign companies are keen to gain access to our reserves and will pay top dollar for them, by setting up joint ventures between them and the state we can save on the equipment required and ensure we get our cut."
 EGY_synthetic_resources: "More Desert Oil"
 EGY_synthetic_resources_desc: "The success of our earlier oil ventures has given rise to a greater demand for exploitation than we have the resources to meet. By legalising and engaging in the sale of oil futures we can gain the capital to expand production extremely quickly."
 EGY_civilian_improvements: "Civilian Improvements"
 EGY_civilian_improvements_desc: "Our policies have begun to pay off in the field of civilian manufacturing, with the manufacturing sector showing strong growth in our major urban centres."
 EGY_dockyards_of_alexandria: "Dockyards of Alexandria"
 EGY_dockyards_of_alexandria_desc: "Alexandria was once the largest and most important port on the Mediterranean, while she may no longer claim this particular honour some expansion of her drydock and anchorage will let us accommodate the young Egyptian fleet more comfortably."
 EGY_industrialization: "Industrialisation Plan"
 EGY_industrialization_desc: "Egyptian industry requires substantial investment if it is to bloom, and to that end we have prepared a battery of policies intended to foster the growth of both heavy and light industries."
 EGY_nile_dams: "Nile Dams"
 EGY_nile_dams_desc: "In 1903 the Nile was dammed by British engineer William Willcocks, now to support the electrification of Egypt we have several further damming projects planned along the White Nile that will provide power for thousands of homes and cities."
 EGY_modernize_sudan: "Modernise Sudan"
 EGY_modernize_sudan_desc: "Thus far most of our efforts in modernisation have focussed on Egypt proper, and Sudan has benefited only marginally. By investing in the major urban centres at Khartoum, Omdurman and Jubba we can extend our reforms southward."
 EGY_resources_of_the_south: "Resources of the South"
 EGY_resources_of_the_south_desc: "We have it on good authority from a geological expedition by the University of Cairo that there are immense mineral deposits in Sudan just waiting to be tapped. Backing a new joint German-Egyptian Chromium concern will allow us to bring heavy industry to our southern reaches and diversify their economy immensely."
 EGY_invest_in_sudan: "Invest in Sudan"
 EGY_invest_in_sudan_desc: "There are any number of rich people, Egyptian or otherwise, who wish to invest in our nation. Perhaps tax incentives could encourage them to take their money southwards, where it will breathe new life into the local economy."
 EGY_expand_railroads: "Expand Railroads Southwards"
 EGY_expand_railroads_desc: "By expanding the rail network in Sudan and making it part of the wider Egyptian rail system we will not only improve the economy but ensure that Sudan is more strongly linked with Egypt proper than the rest of Africa."
 EGY_airports_for_sudan: "Airports for Sudan"
 EGY_airports_for_sudan_desc: "While the railway is a wonderful way to travel it just isn't fast enough for the breakneck pace at which business can move. By investing in air transport links with Khartoum we can ensure that businessmen resident in Cairo and Alexandria can look to their interests in the south at a moment's notice, as well provide air bases for the Royal Egyptian Air Force."
 EGY_army_high_command: "Army High Command"
 EGY_army_high_command_desc: "Our military high command is in need of a shake-up, and our enemies will not wait for our tactics and strategies to update before attacking us!"
 EGY_army_reforms: "Army Reforms"
 EGY_army_reforms_desc: "Much like the great Muhammad Ali, our most prestigious ancestor, we are preparing an extensive overhaul of the armed forces in order to bring them into line with modern military thinking and reform our logistics to support extended campaigning."
 EGY_aviation_reforms: "Aviation Reforms"
 EGY_aviation_reforms_desc: "Currently the Egyptian Army Air Force exists as a branch of the army, wisely organised by our esteemed father. However the growing interest in aviation among the armed forces has prompted [EGY.GetLeader] to introduce legislation creating a separate Egyptian Air Force, which would coordinate with both the navy and the army while being an independent branch of the services."
 EGY_rule_the_skies: "Rule the Skies"
 EGY_rule_the_skies_desc: "Egypt's air force stands ready to enforce her hegemony over the Middle East and much of the Mediterranean. With this powerful symbol of modern armed forces who could dare to resist our might?"
 EGY_egyptian_paratroopers: "Egyptian Paratroopers"
 EGY_egyptian_paratroopers_desc: "A joint proposal by the Egyptian Army and the Egyptian Air Force has come into the Ministry of War, proposing the formation of Sa'ka or \"Thunderbolt\" forces. These men would be elite battalions of the army dropped in by the air force in order to conduct sabotage and seize key objectives behind enemy lines. Their training may begin as soon as the [EGY.GetLeader] wishes."
 EGY_aviation_industry_investment: "More Egyptian Airports"
 EGY_aviation_industry_investment_desc: "To build up the aviation Industry in Egypt, we should focus on building more Airports throughout the realm."
 EGY_air_defence_force: "Air Defence Forces"
 EGY_air_defence_force_desc: "While the capabilities of our pilots are not in doubt they cannot be everywhere. Therefore by royal decree we have founded the Egyptian Air Defence Command, a specialist branch of the military dedicated to building and maintaining anti-air capabilities around urban centres and key infrastructure."
 EGY_bombers: "Bomber Research"
 EGY_bombers_desc: "The powerful, soaring bomber is the weapon of tomorrow. In order to ensure that we can bomb our enemies to smithereens we should devote our resources primarily to cutting-edge bomber technology."
 EGY_battle_ground_support: "Battle-Ground Support"
 EGY_battle_ground_support_desc: "The future of our air doctrine lies in the use of our air force to support the movement of ground forces. By using superior bombers to clear out machine guns, artillery emplacements and static defences we can make fighting that much easier for our boys on the ground."
 EGY_fighters: "Fighter Research"
 EGY_fighters_desc: "The nimble, agile fighter is the weapon of tomorrow. In order to ensure that we can win any dogfight we should devote our resources primarily to cutting-edge fighter technology."
 EGY_dominate_the_sky: "Dominate the Sky"

 EGY_aviation_industry: "Aviation Industry"
 EGY_aviation_industry_desc: "With the fall of Britain to syndicalism many aviation experts were exiled or simply stranded in Egypt with nowhere to go. By offering them employment as technical advisors to the EAF and new state-owned aircraft manufacturers we can tap this rich vein of knowledge."
 EGY_expand_air_ports: "Expand Airports"
 EGY_expand_air_ports_desc: "Construction of additional runways for aircraft will be vital in ensuring we can field a large air force in a modern war. By taking advantage of or large expanses of flat land we can field planes all along the River Nile."

 EGY_pilot_training_desc: "In 1928 when our ministry of war first called for volunteers to found the EAAF over 200 men put themselves forward. However only three were able to pass the rigorous medical examinations. By introducing a harsh fitness regime as well as training in a diverse range of aircraft we can ensure that only the very best become pilots in the new EAF."
 EGY_naval_reforms: "Naval Reforms"
 EGY_naval_reforms_desc: "The Egyptian Navy presently consists of ships seized, purchased or borrowed from other navies, mostly the Royal Navy, or civilian ships pressed into service. In order to create a blue water navy and make Egypt's power apparent on land and sea Sultan Farouk has prepared a package of naval reforms to be pushed forward at once."
 EGY_the_queen_of_the_mediteranian: "Queen of the Mediterranean"
 EGY_the_queen_of_the_mediteranian_desc: "The Egyptian Royal Navy now stands as the equal of any in the Middle East or the Mediterranean. The Egyptian Navy now stands as the Queen of the Mediterranean and let any power dare to challenge it."

 EGY_heavy_cruisers: "Heavy Cruisers"
 EGY_heavy_cruisers_desc: "The use of larger, more heavily armed cruisers will allow us to take the fight to the enemy with confidence. While we may not have the resources to outfit a full battleship we can build cruisers of an extremely high tonnage in order to compensate."
 EGY_grand_navy: "A Grand Navy"
 EGY_grand_navy_desc: "The Egyptian Navy must be grand and imposing, and every bit as prestigious as her army. Prepared to take the fight to the enemy we shall conduct operations far afield and through a combination of submarine warfare and large fleet groups we will smash any threat before it can reach our shores."
 EGY_marine_focus: "Egyptian Marines"
 EGY_marine_focus_desc: "The use of naval assets for army operations has often been a source of service rivalry and contention. By creating an independent Marine Corps we can see to it that specialists in amphibious operations from the navy and army are trained and deployed, unhindered by the petty disputes between other branches."
 EGY_submarines: "Submarine Efforts"
 EGY_submarines_desc: "U-boats are one of the most sophisticated weapons in the hands of the Kaiserliche Marine, and the silent terror of the seas. By adapting some German designs we can further the science and possibly develop our own models."
 EGY_light_cruisers: "Light Cruisers"
 EGY_light_cruisers_desc: "The use of smaller, more lightly armoured scout ships will allow us to disperse forces across a wide area in order to scout our entire coastline and ensure we are able to rapidly respond to enemy incursions."
 EGY_defend_the_coasts: "Defend the Coasts"
 EGY_defend_the_coasts_desc: "The focus of our navies must be on the defence of Egypt's extensive coastline. Smaller patrol ships will allow us to ward off invasion and disrupt any efforts to starve our war machine via submarine warfare."

 EGY_naval_companies: "Egyptian Merchant Marine"
 EGY_naval_companies_desc: "Although we may not have the fleet of a Great Power, it is important that we develop a major merchant fleet to take advantage of our strategic position in the Mediterranean.

 EGY_new_army: "New Egyptian Army"
 EGY_new_army_desc: "Modern, powerful and strong. Not since Muhammad Ali has the army of Egypt been more respected or more feared. Never again shall Egypt be ruled by a foreign power; her armies will see their motherland proud and free."

 EGY_general_staff_desc: "By granting greater autonomy to the Chief of Staff we can create a department modelled on the German General Staff, dedicated to the study of all aspects of warfare and drawing up plans for mobilisation and campaigning. In this way we can effectively marshal our resources and ease the burden of planning on the army."
 EGY_improve_officer_corps: "Improve Officer Corps"
 EGY_improve_officer_corps_desc: "Expanding the curriculum of the newly rechristened Egyptian Military Academy will further extend the education of our officers.

 EGY_planning_schools: "Planning Schools"
 EGY_planning_schools_desc: "By creating specific schools for logistics and operational planning, and pulling officers who excel in these fields from front line duty, we can lay the foundation for a much more professional and sophisticated logistics corps."
 EGY_expand_military_academy: "Expand Military Academy"
 EGY_expand_military_academy_desc: "The Egyptian Military Academy has its roots in our noblest ancestors, but now it is open only to the sons of nobles. Changing these stereotypes would allow talented lower and middle class members of society to enrol and create a brotherhood across class lines in the Egyptian army."
 EGY_grand_battle_plan: "Grand Battle Plan"
 EGY_grand_battle_plan_desc: "Meticulous attention to detail and proper logistics is the key to success in warfare. Let others extend their lines beyond their ability to supply them; Egypt's men shall advance with shells, bullets and guns to spare."
 EGY_strengthen_royal_gendarmerie: "Create Medjay"
 EGY_strengthen_royal_gendarmerie_desc: "The Medjay were a tribe of Nubians in the New Kingdom of Egypt who formed an elite police force. In the current era it has come to be a colloquial name among Pharaonists for the Royal Gendarme, the military police that is to help assist the civilian police. At the Sultan's request we could expand the Gendarme, affording it more resources as well as greater authority in law enforcement."
 EGY_labour_corps: "Labour Corps"
 EGY_labour_corps_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, the British employed many Egyptian labourers in the Egyptian Labour Corps to help provide support for the British Army. We should revive this for the modern Egyptian army. This shall provide not only support for the Army but also provide jobs for the Egyptian people, especially those in the south in Sudan."
 EGY_desert_training: "Desert Training"
 EGY_desert_training_desc: "The defence of the Egyptian nation is best conducted away from her urban centres and the densely populated banks of the Nile. This means operating in the harsh desert conditions of North Africa and Greater Syria, to which end we have created specialised Desert Survival Camps to which all recruits are sent for two months as part of their basic training."
 EGY_domestic_gunsmiths: "Domestic Gunsmiths"
 EGY_domestic_gunsmiths_desc: "While there has been a cottage industry of gunmaking in Egypt for centuries a modern army demands mass production of firearms. Encouraging the consolidation of smaller firms and a move towards newer models will keep us well stocked with modern firearms."
 EGY_desert_mobility: "Fast as the Desert Wind"
 EGY_desert_mobility_desc: "Our theorists have been developing and formalising a doctrine based around coordination between units, in order to move as quickly as possible and conduct operations at a breakneck pace. Like a sandstorm blowing out of the desert the Egyptian army can commence an attack and fall upon the enemy before they can coordinate a response."
 EGY_motorized_efforts: "Motorised Efforts"
 EGY_motorized_efforts_desc: "Cavalry is all well and good, but the future of warfare relies on motorised vehicles. By instituting a training programme that teaches our conscripts to drive alongside their basic training we can lay the ground for the mobile army of the 20th century."
 EGY_royal_camel_corps: "Royal Camel Corps"
 EGY_royal_camel_corps_desc: "The Royal Camel Corps is a continuation of the formerly British-officered Egyptian Camel Corps. Camels are hardy beasts suited to desert environments, and their use in warfare has been known for centuries. By formalising their place in our military doctrine we can further adapt our men to the environment of their homeland."
 EGY_shendi_horses: "Shendi Horses"
 EGY_shendi_horses_desc: "In order to ensure the cavalry have access to fine horses Sultan Farouk has proposed a programme whereby land suitable for pasture in Sudan, situated mostly around the town of Shendi, would be given over to stud farming by the Royal Agricultural Society. The RAS will also offer favourable rates for purebred Arabians from the studs of the nobility."
 EGY_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare Plan"
 EGY_mobile_warfare_desc: "The greatest advantage an army can possess is speed. Being able to fall upon the foe before they know what is happening and pursue them faster than they can retreat is how we will smash our foes."

 EGY_bureaucracy_reforms: "Bureaucracy Reforms"
 EGY_bureaucracy_reforms_desc: "Day-to-day bureaucracy is required to run a modern state with any kind of efficiency, to that end the hiring of officials must be overhauled to create a single system. Two camps are emerging pushing different ideas: one calls for meritocratic examinations to be given, the other for pedigree and tradition to be respected."
 EGY_administrative_reforms: "Administrative Reforms"
 EGY_administrative_reforms_desc: "Currently in Egypt the state's power is based around notable locals, be they land owners or village headmen. This is an obvious area of priority for our young Sultan, who aims to standardise administration into four dozen governorates. The question now becomes who should be appointed to each one, and how?"
 EGY_judical_reforms: "Judical Reforms"
 EGY_judical_reforms_desc: "Egypt's court system was innovative in 1875, however jurisprudence has moved on. Now, with collaboration of jurists from the University of Cairo, [EGY.GetLeader] intends to overhaul the legal process. This affords the various factions in the Government to help influence exactly what that means."
 EGY_liberalization_of_trade_policies: "Liberalization of Trade Policies"
 EGY_liberalization_of_trade_policies_desc: "Almost all of the publicly-owned companies are doing poorly, suffering from mismanagement and even corruption. Rather than revise their practices, perhaps it's best to put them back in the hands of the private sector where they can be run by proper businessmen rather than bureaucrats."
 EGY_monopoly_over_financial_endowments: "Monopoly Over Financial Endowments"
 EGY_monopoly_over_financial_endowments_desc: "There are many financial endowments in the society, most are religious donation and some are organization donation.These money flowing will easily create a place for tax avoidance, we should create a section to supervise them."

 EGY_wipe_out_illiteracy: "Wipe Out Illiteracy"
 EGY_wipe_out_illiteracy_desc: "As part of the reforms that [EGY.GetLeader] is bringing about to Egypt the topic of literacy has been brought up. The vast majority of Egypt's population is illiterate with nearly an 80% illiteracy rate, principally within the rural areas. To counter this a programme of educating the population is to begin. However, while most believe the focus should be on Egyptian Arabic, a few believe that we should focus on revitalising the Coptic Language."
 EGY_publicize_the_universities: "Publicize the Universities"
 EGY_publicize_the_universities_desc: "It is not enough simply to rely on foreign experts to run our businesses. The creation of several publicized new Austrian-style institutes of technology and research universities that will teach not just the liberal arts but physics, chemical engineering and nuclear science will greatly expand the knowledge base of our nation and provide skilled workers for modern industries."
 EGY_education_reforms: "Education Reforms"
 EGY_education_reforms_desc: "Education will lay the foundation for the future of our new Egypt, but the topic of history can easily become controversial if not handled properly. Ultimately, the words of [EGY.GetLeader] will carry a lot of weight, so the focus of Egyptian history should be on the Pharaonic period and the Islamic past should be rejected ..."
 EGY_invite_foreign_investors: "Invite Foreign Investors"
 EGY_invite_foreign_investors_desc: "A steady influx of foreign capital is needed in order to prevent our economy from stagnating.And we should invite foreign businesses to brought forward a proposal aimed at making investments in our industry more lucrative,and attractive to foreign entrepreneurs by introducing tax cuts and diversifying our exports."
