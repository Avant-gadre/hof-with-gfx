But this was less of a problem than the extreme right. After the Hungarian Communist Party's power was restricted, the National Will Party, founded by social nationalist Ferenc Szalács, a retired military officer who advocated "class cooperation," quickly filled the Communist Party's influence and, with the support of the cavalry general Attila, absorbed several far-right parties that had been scattered and were strong enough to launch a march on Budapest."

The revolution took place further, which, of course, gave Count Bathory a good excuse to dismiss him from the army. \n\nNow that the Dacians in the east are once again on the move, Prunet, instead of his ragged men, also supported by the cavalry general Attila, petitioning for reinstatement, might as well send them to Transylvania?"
