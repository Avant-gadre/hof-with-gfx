Now that the case has been referred to the grand court, the final judge, Shikieiki Yamaxanadu, faces a dilemma between the reformist bureaucrats and senior courtiers of the court.

The meeting decided that the "Ketsumeidan"(Blood League), a right-wing private group established a few days ago, used the strategy of "One Man, One Assassination" to assassinate important ministers, political figures, palace veterans, and Zaibatsu leaders. "Slow religious reforms have failed," said Houjuu Nue, who was dressed in black and could not recognize his face. "Renewal must be achieved within 1936.""

Although she has obtained a lot of economic benefits for Japan in many foreign affairs, and has also worked hard to win some trust in Western countries, the "non-interference policy" she advocates on the issue of China's civil war is regarded as weak. And now, she is now an important figure to be assassinated by the Blood League. \nYesterday, Lieutenant Mikami Taku led the two rushed into Marisa’s personal apartment in Tokyo, but their actions were discovered by Misty who had just returned home. The two sides engaged in a fierce gun battle in the corridor of the apartment.

The opposite theory of "the sovereignty of the Empress" holds that "the Empress is the state, and the rule belongs to the Empress." \nThe dispute between the two constitutional doctrines was originally confined to academia, but Inubashiri Momizi, a former Lieutenant General, in Kizuko In, thought the doctrine was "anti-nationalistic" and called for the removal of Okazaki Yumemi from the higher Education examination Institute in Kizuko In. At the same time, Professor Kuzuki Souichirou of the Professional School of the Imperial College criticized the "Criminal Law handout" and "Criminal Law Reader" published by Onozuka Komachi, believing that Onozuka "advocated Marxism" in the book and reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs that the publication of the two books should be banned."

The Greater Japan production Party was founded to realize the unity of the Japanese right on the basis of Greater Japanism and to promote the cause of reform.

Establish industrial power and overthrow capitalism;\n3. Overcome the domestic class antagonism, in order to promote the national prestige in the world.
