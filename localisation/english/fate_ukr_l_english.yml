 ukr_western.1.d:0 ""The revolutionary boldness of the Russians and the pragmatic spirit of the Americans combined are the essence of Leninism in the work of the Party and the work of the State." So said Joseph Dzhugashvili in 1928. It is not necessary to say what the "revolutionary courage of the Russians" was, but the "Americans" were the American environmentalist, engineer, and now senator from New York, Muir Seth. The "work of the Party" here refers to the Dnieper River hydroelectric power plant. Anna Morozova's article claims that the Dnieper hydroelectric power plant was the first major step toward communism, but she and those at the top of the power hierarchy knew that they needed not only Soviet leadership but also capitalist efficiency to achieve their goals. The U.S. Army's Command in Chita had a staff of five or six men, and the White Russian government in Chita remained the only officially recognized legitimate regime in Russia, but this did not at all prevent a group of American advisors from being invited to live in brick houses in the "American Garden City" with two tennis courts and a golf course, to provide American expertise to the managers and engineers of the Dnepr River hydroelectric power plant, and to receive large orders from Moscow for turbines and generators from Newport News Shipbuilding and General Electric. At the head of these American consultants was Muelsyse. \n\nMuelsyse is the chief designer of the entire Dnepr River hydroelectric power plant and basin renovation project. As a young environmentalist and civil engineer, Muelsyse shot to prominence by designing the Toronto hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls and was previously involved in the treatment of the St. Lawrence River. Before she could negotiate a scope of services for the Dnieper River hydroelectric project, Moscow deposited $50,000 into Muelsyse's account. She immediately accepted the offer. The original planned investment for the Dnieper hydroelectric power plant was $50 million, however, by the time it was completed the investment had increased eightfold. Anna Morozova, a central figure in the Supreme Soviet, was on hand to preside over the completion ceremony. Speeches were made, praising communism, and Muelsyse and five other American advisers were presented with the Order of the Red Banner of Labor for their contributions to the cause of communist construction."

 ukr_western.2.d:0 "Leo Harvey, politician of the French Democratic-Republican Union and heir to a new generation of a prominent young French entrepreneurial family, now begins his journey to the Soviet Union. Although France was involved in the Soviet civil war with a small force to fight the Bolsheviks, the Parisian side was currently not interested in maintaining the lingering White Bandit regime in Chita due to its own political instability. After some politicians in Paris and Moscow had been exchanging glances for some time, Leo Harvey, the leader of the Democratic-Republican Union, finally decided to visit the Soviet Union in order to increase mutual understanding between the two countries. Leo Harvey was a standard big bourgeois in the Marxist-Leninist sense, but this did not prevent him from being greeted by an honor guard at the Kiev airport and staying in one of Kiev's luxurious hotels, picking up Ukrainian specialties from the foreign store. But this was not so easy and pleasant for the NKVD. The loyal NKVD officers had to fill the empty street stores with decorative food, hide the starving people a block away, and train the school children how to answer the French capitalist's questions. Also, guard against the dastardly assassinations of Ukrainian nationalists and anarchists. \n\nLeo Harvey was very pleased with his visit, and at the school called "Familiy of Felix Dzerzhinsky" he learned that the pupils could eat grilled fish or beef every week. He was soon introduced to the advanced achievements of Soviet industrialization. It seems that he had a lot of preconceptions about the Soviet Union, but that could not be helped, after all, he was a capitalist. \n\nHarvey was also a gourmet, but he always ate in moderation and with a balance of meat and vegetables so that he did not get fat. His next stop was Moscow, where he would taste the most authentic caviar bread and beet soup. Upon his return to Paris, Leo Harvey called the Ukrainian collective farms orderly gardens, and Pravda happily reported Leo Harvey's assessment. The story ends happily."

 ukr_western.3.d:0 "In a recent press conference in London, Soviet exiled military officer Yakir angrily complained about the brutal political purges on the part of Moscow and the tragic results of the failed policy in the Ukrainian region. This accusation appears to have greatly discredited Moscow and their followers around the world, but it also smacks the Western world in the face just as hard. Still, Yakir's accusation is one-sided, lacking more evidence, and more civilians and politicians don't really care what is going on in Ukraine, with some still believing that the Soviet Union has been officially slandered. \n\n "Yakir's accusations are a complete fabrication," is precisely the position of Walter Duranty, a Moscow-based columnist for the New York Times and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. In his New York Times column, Duranty repeatedly claimed that Yakir's statement at the London conference was "a horror story of grandstanding" and that "there was no famine at all," but only "widespread deaths due to malnutrition-induced disease. There is no famine", but "widespread deaths due to malnutrition-induced diseases". This is quite close to the official position of Moscow. Duranty also pointed out that the so-called purges and famines are subordinate to a higher purpose: "You can't fry an egg without breaking it." . \n\nWhile our news media and politicians were arguing about it or watching, the Germans had already taken the lead in public opinion. The portly Hermann Göring claimed that the famine, as Yakir called it, was "all due to Marxism," while Siegfried's royal man of letters, Alfred Rosenberg, claimed that it was part of Moscow's "oppression of the Ukrainian people." The German propaganda machine has already begun to seize this opportunity to run at a fast pace, while our intelligence agencies are not yet able to confirm what is really happening in Ukraine."

The command of the Ukrainian military district, which belonged to him after the end of Dzhugashvili, has finally returned, and the new First Secretary Brezhnev is not interested in, and even less capable of, interfering in military affairs, and urgently needs the army's help in pacifying the population and suppressing infiltrators. This is what Yakir wanted, some infantry units do not have to participate in the recently restarted mechanized exercises, so they will go to various places to assist in defense at the request of the first secretary. However, the army's massive intervention seems to have backfired, even if the soldiers specializing in warfare are not as professional as the police in terms of arresting people, they can't always let people go, right? \n\nNow Marshal Tukhachevsky's message came at the right time, the new Minister of Internal Affairs Beria investigation that there is a certain amount of nationalist infiltrators in the Ukrainian military zone and therefore requested a comprehensive review, Yakir, of course, did not hesitate to agree, in this regard still rely on the Ministry of Internal Affairs to work, anyway, now this group of blue hats can not turn up the waves. What's more, during the Jugashvili period he had been trying to do with his tail between his legs to avoid being arrested one day, and indeed did not understand anything about the loyalty of his subordinates. After \n\n replied to the letter, Yakir suddenly remembered an extremely worrying question. Could it be that the Ministry of Internal Affairs during the reign of Jugashvili did not consider this aspect? The man who was so concerned about loyalty could tolerate the army being infiltrated by a group of exiles? Instead, it is only today that such a major issue is being considered?"

On closer inspection, it became clear how serious the situation was: there were nationalist associates in every division of the Ukrainian military district? And the so-called "Great Uprising" was to find a suitable moment to detonate the Dnepr hydroelectric power station at the inevitable outbreak of the Russian civil war? The rebels will first attack the Ukrainian military district headquarters and then take control of the city of Kiev, where the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile will return across the Bosnian-Soviet border to lead the rebel forces as planned, and a war no less than the one in 1919 will be repeated in this land!
