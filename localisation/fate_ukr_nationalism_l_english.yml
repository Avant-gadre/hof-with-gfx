 ukr.10.t:0 "Composition of the Ukrainian Independence Army"
 ukr.10.d:0 "Just like the hastily formed ranks that rebelled against Tsarist Russia and the Bolshevik revolutionaries twenty years earlier, the Ukrainian rebels, who had seized upon the failed policy of Dzhugashvili, were still a rabble of soldiers from all walks of life. The Ukrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party and the Ukrainian Social-Revolutionary Party were consolidated under the leadership of Simon Petliura, and after the defeat of the First War of Independence the remnants went into exile in France. Some members of the Ukrainian Social Revolutionary Party joined the Bolsheviks, but most of them were imprisoned during the first purges against the Ukrainian regional communist parties in 1932-1934. As Britain, France, and the United States ignored the demands of Ukrainian exiles for independence and the complaints of famine in Ukraine, some generals loyal to Simon Petliura began contacts with the newly emerging Germany after their exile. The most enthusiastic German advocate of Ukrainian independence was undoubtedly Alfred Rosenberg, a leading theoretician of the German People's Party, who first contacted Simon Petliura in Paris in 1934.\nThe radical right wing, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), led by Yevhen Konovalets, chose instead to launch a campaign of resistance and sabotage against the Polish occupiers in the Polish-occupied regions of Galicia and Volynia. As the Polish government became increasingly authoritarian, repression against ethnic Ukrainians intensified, just as the OUN had hoped, and in 1934, the OUN's newest leader, Stepan Bandera, shocked all of Europe by organizing the successful assassination of Polish Interior Minister Bronisław Piełacki. Beginning in 1935, the Polish government began to systematically drive OUN-trained militias into Soviet territory and to take in Ukrainian peasants who had fled to Poland because of hunger. Through this series of actions, the Polish government successfully used the failure of Soviet policy in Ukraine to induce Ukrainian nationalists to turn against the Soviet Union.\nDespite widespread repression, the conservative old Cossack groups still had some influence among Ukrainian peasants. The former Habsburg Vasyl Vyshvany led this conservative force. His ally, the former Gaitman Pavel Skoropatsky, had collaborated with the invaders of the German Empire to expel the Russian Empire and Bolshevik influence. Nevertheless, the conservatives led by Skoropatsky maintained their ties with the Imperial Russian government in Chita. Unlike Skoropatsky, Vyshvany had his own intentions regarding Ukraine.\nThere was also a most unusual resistance force, the anarchist Black Army led by Néstor Makhno. The anarchists had allied themselves with the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War, but then clashed with them to the point where they were finally annihilated. Makhno himself went into exile in France, where he joined other socialists in their struggle against the restored Bourbon government. Dzhugashvili's brutal policy and failed repression in Ukraine led to a resurgence of anarchism among the peasantry, and a former Red Army officer under General Tukhachevsky, Buldrokas'tee, joined the anarchist partisans directly. This time, anarchists and nationalists seemed to be temporary allies in the fight against the Bolsheviks, but there was no doubt that they would eventually come to confront each other. Only one conception of Ukraine would triumph."

 ukr.11.d:0 "Yevhen Konovalets, the founder of the Ukrainian Nationalist Organization (OUN), was a thorn in the side of the Polish government in Warsaw, the Soviet government in Moscow, and the Russian imperial government in Chita. Yevhen Konovalets had seized an army of Ukrainians from the old Austrian Empire in 1918 to support Simon Petliura, and went into exile after the failure of Ukrainian independence. In its program, the OUN proclaimed that it would \"enslave other nations for the freedom of Ukraine\"; in its actions, it often resorted to terrorism in its confrontation with Poland and the Soviet Union. In its actions, the OUN often resorted to terrorist methods in its confrontation with Poland and the Soviet Union, such as assassination of dignitaries, destruction of facilities, and assassination of Ukrainians who tried to cooperate with the authorities, in order to provoke conflicts between them. These acts were undoubtedly hated by Warsaw, Moscow and Chita.\n\nAs Simon Petliura returned to Ukraine to take part in the uprising against Moscow, Konovalets also came to Ukraine to join the fight by organizing the OUN militia. Konovalets' alliance with Petliura was temporary, but solid, at least for this short period of time. This was also clear on the part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet intelligence agency NKVD had previously developed numerous assassination plans against Konovalets. Today, Konovalets arrived at the Kyiv station, where an NKVD agent disguised as a delivery man presented him with a box of cakes sent to him by his friend, which was a carefully disguised bomb."

The sewn-up Ukrainian resistance will soon be plunged into spoils-sharing infighting.\n\nBut as long as the alliance between Petliura and Konovalets does not split, this will not happen either. Yet the fundamental philosophical conflict between the two is simply too great, and continued cooperation will only make their respective ideals unattainable in compromise.\n\nHowever, more than a decade ago, it was the former Austro-Hungarian Army \"Sechi Riflemen\" led by Konovalets that provided Petliura with the crucial force that enabled the latter to ascend to the position of head of the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic. So why not continue the cooperation? It's all for Ukraine."

Melnik, the old comrade with the will in hand, was soon ousted by the young radical Stepan Bandera, whose reputation among his peers was so high that it was only logical that he should take over the leadership. However, Bandera himself was extremely violent and had already turned the tables on the \"old guys\", who had ceded territories to the Poles in the past and were guilty of unforgivable acts. Now that the only former leader who could stabilize the situation is gone, there is no one left to stop him from carrying out his radical plans."
