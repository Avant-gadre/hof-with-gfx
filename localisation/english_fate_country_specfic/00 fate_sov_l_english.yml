  more_ukraine_dlc.1.d: ""What? Comrade Khrushchev... No, no! The traitor Khrushchev? How dare he openly plot rebellion in Moscow?!" \n\n Hearing the news that Khrushchev had been imprisoned in Moscow for colluding with the Tukhachevsky group in a coup plot, Brezhnev, who was having a drinking party with his friends, broke out in a cold sweat, but fortunately Pavel Sudopradov, head of the Ukrainian regional NKVD, brought good news at the same time. \n\n "Don't be too nervous, you have been working actively during your tenure and have never participated in the Khrushchev cabal, and it has been decided by the higher authorities that you should continue to act in his place temporarily." \n\n "Okay... Well... I understand... Oh thanks... Thank you!""

  more_ukraine_dlc.3.d: "Sudopradov brings another good news, the counter-revolutionary Khrushchev has been executed in Moscow, and Brezhnev will not be disciplined for not catching Yakir and others, not to mention no longer being acting First Secretary of Ukraine -- is now the proper First Secretary of Ukraine! As for Mehlis, he was handcuffed and put on a plane to Moscow three days ago to be tried for conspiring to assassinate Dzhugashvili...\n\nAfter all, the head of the NKVD had already taken the top job, and all the NKVD officials were in a position to serve them well. Sudopradov and his entourage played at Brezhnev's Kiev residence until midnight when they left drunkenly, and it was only when the NKVD limousine was out of sight that the red-faced newly promoted officials took a breather and finally sent the group of gods away."

  more_ukraine_dlc.4.t: "The Moscow Incident"
  more_ukraine_dlc.4.d: ""What? Comrade Khrushchev?! You... What? My God! How did this happen?!" \n\nOn the phone call from Khrushchev himself Brezhnev learned that a series of events had occurred after his trip to Moscow, which by mistake had broken through the secret purge being carried out by the Dzhugashvili, and ended with Marshal Tukhachevsky leading his troops into Moscow to subvert the Dzhugashvili regime. Khrushchev was so shocked as the central figure that he had to stay in Moscow for a while to recuperate from the prison of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but he didn't forget Brezhnev and immediately recommended him to continue acting as the First Secretary of Ukraine under the new regime on the grounds of his "good performance" until the situation on the ground was completely stabilized. \n\nIn that case, Brezhnev's first order was to arrest the Mehlis, who was too much for the dog, but I did not expect that this guy was quite conscious that he was not in his office and residence, or the Black Sea Fleet called to say that the head of the Political Department suddenly came to the port of Sevastopol and took a yacht in the name of vacation but drove out of the territorial waters at maximum horsepower."

  more_ukraine_dlc.5.d1: "Becoming a hand is not as comfortable as one might expect, and Brezhnev must deal with one troublesome problem after another. The purges of the Ministry of Internal Affairs against the Ukrainian military districts have led to the disintegration of the local Red Army. The activities of Ukrainian nationalists, who have long been under the patronage of forces outside the country, have become more and more frequent, and these bastards are no longer satisfied with subversive activities under loose supervision. The detection of OUN propaganda materials in the Red Army barracks is simply unprecedented. \n\nBut, for the sake of their own glorious future, this kind of thing should not always bother the central government, Brezhnev believes that this group of people can not make a big deal after all, as long as more strikes in recent days should be able to solve the problem, it is difficult to see how they still have the ability to rise up and rebel?"
  more_ukraine_dlc.5.d2: "Being in charge is not as comfortable as one might think, Brezhnev has to deal with one troublesome problem after another. The political turmoil in Moscow has affected Ukraine to some extent. Ukrainian nationalists, who have long been under the patronage of forces outside the country, are becoming more active, and recently several cases have been received concerning attacks on party and military personnel. On balance, the situation is not good, and there are no fewer cases of anti-Soviet violence in the eastern Russian-speaking regions than in the west. \n\nAlas! Blame it on the damned Dzhugashvili! Brezhnev also had to adopt a carrot-and-stick policy to appease the cornered and take out the recalcitrant!"

  more_ukraine_dlc.8.d1: "The anarchist's exile in [FRA.GetName] was not as "good" as expected, and Néstor Makhno almost died in a hospital for the poor on the outskirts of Paris because he could not afford to treat his illness. Since the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty, no matter how the powers that be beautify themselves always can not hide the stench of a dictatorship, for Makhno as the representative of the radical left-wing exiles even if there is no overt persecution, behind the scenes is certainly not want them to get out early. \n\n "Fortunately, soon I won't have to stay here." Machnow envied his good fortune, and now he has a whole new group of followers by his side. These good boys are all as energetic and daring as he was a dozen years ago, and I think that even without himself, the dream of freedom will continue... Don't think so badly! Anyway pack up and get ready to go home!!!"
  more_ukraine_dlc.8.d2: "When it really came time to go back, Néstor Mahnou suddenly felt a bit sad to go back. Indeed the ethos of [FRA.GetName] is changing for the better, and as a leading anarchist he had to admit this, even the hospital for the poor where he used to live had undergone some renovations, and after his discharge he was lucky enough to meet the legendary Joan of Arc on the streets of Paris, and the two great figures from different fields then spent the afternoon chatting in the café about all kinds of problems. \n \n "Unfortunately, I have other things to do, ah." Now Machnow is surrounded by a whole new group of followers, these good kids are all as energetic and daring as they were a decade ago, perhaps even without themselves, the dream of freedom will continue... Hey! Can not think so, as a father is to take responsibility! Anyway, pack up and get ready to go home!"
  more_ukraine_dlc.8.d3: "When it's time to go back, Néstor Makhno is really sad to go back... Really can't let go! [FRA.GetName] after the revolution basically fulfilled his dream, I really did not expect that all those words that Miss Jeanne said in the cafe are now fulfilled, I really want to stay here to add to the hard-earned freedom commune ah! \n\n "Unfortunately, I have other things to do." Now Makhno is surrounded by a whole new group of followers, good boys who think just like their past selves, who have seen the success of [FRA.GetName] and are hot on the trail of blood and are impatiently seeking the next revolutionary battlefield. And the news from the Ukrainian nationalists shows that a new storm is soon to break out in the Bolshevik-ruled Ukraine, and since the kids are fist-pumping, Pops can't continue to be old and serious. Get ready to go home!"  
  more_ukraine_dlc.8.d4: "Néstor Makhno didn't think he'd ever find the Ukrainian nationalists agreeable, who made France look like this? As people of conscience should stay and resist the mob of the Black Virgin, but in front of the increasingly harsh repression all existing resistance actions are futile, even if not for their unfinished business is now the time to leave. \n\nSee the French comrades have asked to go with Makhno can not help but old tears, when finished unfinished business must come back to liberate France, certainly!"

  more_ukraine_dlc.9.t: "Parachute!"
  more_ukraine_dlc.9.d: "Brezhnev received very bad news today! A garrison patrolling the outskirts of Kiev found buried Italian... Roman-made parachute! It was obvious that this could not be some aviation club activity nor some airborne exercise. The First Secretary immediately ordered the police to investigate and to his surprise, parachutes were found hidden all over Ukraine! Based on the traces of dirt extrapolated from the fact that they landed about a week ago, counting the parachutes that may not have been found yet, the criminal investigators extrapolated that at least about three battalions of enemy agents had infiltrated."

  more_ukraine_dlc.10.d: "With a smile on his face, Roman Shukhovich handed the Red Army soldier who came to check him out a fine cigarette that only officers could have, and the latter did not see it as an overstep; even in the tightly controlled Soviet society, one could still get these hard currencies through the underground black market to get through the deeply flawed centralized system. The Russian-speaking soldier didn't ask any more questions and let the wagon full of "cargo" pass through, expecting that the black-market grain wagon would "help" the folks nearby. \n\nAs the advance commander of the Ukrainian insurgency, Shukhovich thought it was necessary to dismantle the Bolshevik grassroots, and that it would be feasible to use the famine caused by the authorities to push people against the Red bandits, but the further east you go, the more people will think they are the "bandits," and it will take a lot of time to prove the legitimacy of your side."

  more_ukraine_dlc.11.t: "Sabotage operations against collective farms"
  more_ukraine_dlc.11.d1: "According to the OUN's anti-Soviet propaganda, [SOV.GetName]'s policy of collectivization of agriculture is essentially the plundering of peasant blood transfusion industries, and the already cruel economic policy in practice has even seen the expropriation of peasant seeds and rations, and the Kiev side cannot yet tell whether there will be more scale of sabotage or even uprisings. According to the concept of "permanent revolution" put forward by Stepan Bandera, the head of the Ukrainian nationalist organization's propaganda, and Shukhovich, the head of infiltration operations, the Ukrainian nationalist revolution had to return the blood and violence to the Bolsheviks intact. Thus, Shukhevich planned a series of terrorist attacks against the managers of collective farms, such as when farm workers woke up to see Bolshevik cadres hanging on the walls or thrown in the wheat fields, but the teams were strict in selecting their targets before doing so, and only those with deep grievances learned during the "grain trafficking" process were executed. Only then were they punished. Shukhevich believed that this was the way to change the stereotype of the "gangsters" and to show the general public that we were the righteous ones who had come to save the Ukrainian people from the clutches of the criminals! Of course this Robin Hood behavior won't last long, each attack will make the next one more difficult, and we can only hope for a thundering, lightning-fast, all-Ukrainian uprising sooner rather than later, before it develops into an uncontrollable vendetta."
  more_ukraine_dlc.11.d2: "According to the OUN's anti-Soviet propaganda, [SOV.GetName]'s policy of collectivization of agriculture was essentially the plundering of peasants to transfuse industry, and the already brutal economic policy in practice even saw the expropriation of peasant seeds and rations, which unfortunately has now been reversed to some extent by the Moscow authorities. According to the concept of "permanent revolution" put forward by Stepan Bandera, the head of propaganda of the Ukrainian nationalist organizations, together with Shukhovich, the head of infiltration operations, the Ukrainian national revolution must return the blood and violence to the Bolsheviks intact. But to do so would have made the insurgents "gangsters," and Shukhevich had to select a few disgruntled people to assassinate, and spend additional effort to inform the public about the authorities' genocidal attempts to "deliberately create a famine. Who would have thought that the insurgents would have to deliberately maintain the opposition between Ukrainians and Bolsheviks? Some of the more radical members even suggested that the opportunity should be taken to insert the anti-Semitic doctrine that by some logic it should be deduced that the managers of the kibbutzim were Jews who took orders from Moscow."

  more_ukraine_dlc.12.d: "The fundamental reason why Shukhevich deliberately kept the image of the righteous division is still the lack of manpower, it is impossible to start a national revolution with the exile forces alone, what else can be done to overthrow the Bolshevik rule in Ukraine but to rely on the locals? GetName]The efficiency of the internal affairs department's counter-intelligence is one of the best in the world. A few years ago, the infiltration of such as now is estimated to be trapped by the "Blue Hats" in a week or so. \n\n But I don't know whether it was luck or Bolshevik negligence, but since that Yezhov became the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the propaganda materials of the insurgent army were sent to the Red Army barracks, and many local East Ukrainian soldiers thus established underground contacts with their compatriots in exile in the West, and now many officers have heard about the absurdity of the political struggle in Moscow, and their original wavering mentality has been seriously skewed to the West, but even so, they were prompted to The immediate conditions for them to leave everything behind and join the uprising have not yet been met, and Shukhevich's task is to stabilize the rebels of the Red Army in Eastern Ukraine until then, and to carry out sabotage in order to draw the attention of the Moscow authorities away from further investigation of the Ukrainian military zone."
