 ror.13.desc: "France is expanding its faction in the name of "Catholic Crusader". Maybe we have really underestimate those Catholics. It seems that we have to abandon some of old conflicts with Italians and help them, but this means that confrontation with global zealots."

 lr_france.20.d: "It was the military conquest of our great emperor Napoleon I that brought the awakening of national consciousness to the Apennine Peninsula, so they should have allied with us... Well, naturally it's not that simple, and after a lot of things happen our relationship doesn't get so good. But one thing is certain, they proclaim Rome is just for seizing territory, and we could separate some meaningless colonies in this regard, and it would be good for both of us if it could form a military alliance."

Naturally our new empire must have a duel with them, but in terms of our strength, it is very troublesome to deal with a family. of. So the French emperor Napoleon I proposed that the eastern part of French West Africa and Somaliland be exchanged for our alliance with him, and at the same time he hinted that we would use this land to attack the Republic of Congo, which was independent from Belgium in recent years. This is not only a good opportunity to expand the colony, but also gives us military backing."
 lr_france.21.a: "A nice proposal."
 lr_france.21.b: "Then give us Savoy and Corsica too!" 
 
 lr_france.22.t: "They also want Savoy and Corsica..."
 lr_france.22.d: "It must be said that the wings of this group of Lombard barbarians have grown longer and more arrogant. Our friendly alliance proposal has turned into their opportunity to claim territory. Savoy and Corsica? ! What a joke? ! If it is necessary to say that there are indeed many Italians in these two areas, and it is indeed the Apennine land that was once merged into France, then ..."

 lr_france.25.t: "France returned Corsica"
 lr_france.25.d: "The French agreed to partly add Corsica on the basis of the original agreement, so that Corsica, which once belonged to Genoa, and many compatriots will return together! After all, this is the hoemtown of the French Emperor, and it is still quite sincere to give it away."
 lr_france.25.a: "A good result."
 lr_france.25.b: "And what about Savoy?"   
 
 lr_france.26.t: "France has met our demands"
