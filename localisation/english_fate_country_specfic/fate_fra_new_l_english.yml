 ror.13.t: "Crusaders?!"
 ror.13.desc: "France is expanding its faction in the name of "Catholic Crusader". Maybe we have really underestimate those Catholics. It seems that we have to abandon some of old conflicts with Italians and help them, but this means that confrontation with global zealots."

 lr_france.20.t: "A possibility of Mediterranean Alliance"
 lr_france.20.d: "It was the military conquest of our great emperor Napoleon I that brought the awakening of national consciousness to the Apennine Peninsula, so they should have allied with us... Well, naturally it's not that simple, and after a lot of things happen our relationship doesn't get so good. But one thing is certain, they proclaim Rome is just for seizing territory, and we could separate some meaningless colonies in this regard, and it would be good for both of us if it could form a military alliance."
 lr_france.20.a: "We can give them parts of West Africa and Somaliland."
 lr_france.20.b: "France is indivisible!"
 
 lr_france.21.t: "France hopes to offer thier colonies for an alliance"
 lr_france.21.d: "No matter how the British and French advertise themselves, they will firmly divide the positive African continent into two large pieces and hold it in their hands. Naturally our new empire must have a duel with them, but in terms of our strength, it is very troublesome to deal with a family. of. So the French emperor Napoleon I proposed that the eastern part of French West Africa and Somaliland be exchanged for our alliance with him, and at the same time he hinted that we would use this land to attack the Republic of Congo, which was independent from Belgium in recent years. This is not only a good opportunity to expand the colony, but also gives us military backing."
 lr_france.21.a: "A nice proposal."
 lr_france.21.b: "Then give us Savoy and Corsica too!" 
 
 lr_france.22.t: "They also want Savoy and Corsica..."
 lr_france.22.d: "It must be said that the wings of this group of Lombard barbarians have grown longer and more arrogant. Our friendly alliance proposal has turned into their opportunity to claim territory. Savoy and Corsica? ! What a joke? ! If it is necessary to say that there are indeed many Italians in these two areas, and it is indeed the Apennine land that was once merged into France, then ..."
 lr_france.22.a: "No way!"
 lr_france.22.b: "Try to offer them Savoy."  
 lr_france.22.c: "Give them Corsica..."
 lr_france.22.e: "Satisfy thier demands."   
 
 lr_france.24.t: "France returned Savoy"
 lr_france.24.d: "The French agreed to add a part of the Savoy region on the basis of the original agreement, so that the former hometown of the kingdom will come back with many compatriots!"
 lr_france.24.a: "A good result."
 lr_france.24.b: "And what about Corsica?"  
 
 lr_france.25.t: "France returned Corsica"
 lr_france.25.d: "The French agreed to partly add Corsica on the basis of the original agreement, so that Corsica, which once belonged to Genoa, and many compatriots will return together! After all, this is the hoemtown of the French Emperor, and it is still quite sincere to give it away."
 lr_france.25.a: "A good result."
 lr_france.25.b: "And what about Savoy?"   
 
 lr_france.26.t: "France has met our demands"
 lr_france.26.d: "We have no reason to refuse then..."
 lr_france.26.a: "Nice, no problem."
 lr_france.26.b: "I have changed my mind, we want the whole Gaul!"  
 
 lr_france.27.t: "They have refused."
 lr_france.27.d: "After our unprecedented concession, the arrogant "Roman" refused. It seems that it was a mistake from the beginning."
 lr_france.27.a: "We will parade at Rome."

 ror.15.t: "The life-and-death time"
 ror.15.d: "There is a saying that has been circulating in our country, "Historically, cooperation with the Germans will never end well," but now it seems that we can't help it. If the situation really deteriorates like this, then everything is over."
 ror.15.a: "Propose an alliance to Germans"
 ror.15.b: "Never clean shoes for Germans."  
 
 ror.16.t: "They are coming to clean our shoes"
 ror.16.d: "The Italians's Mediterranean ambitions are over, and now they want to join us to save the situation. After all, everyone still has a common enemy. If you sit back and watch, some guys will only grow stronger, and we can also take the opportunity to propose to reclaim Austrian territory as long as they have the ability to return it to us."
 ror.16.a: "Only if they return South Tyrol."
 ror.16.b: "They die by themselves!"  
 
 ror.17.t: "South Tyrol for Alliance"
 ror.17.d: "Naturally, the Germans could not relieve the South Tyrol lost in the last war. Even at this time, they still insisted on the territorial sovereignty of the area, and we seem to have no way to refuse ..."
 ror.17.a: "Then give them the land."
 ror.17.b: "Never clean shoes for Germans."

 alice_event.1.t: "The suburbs of Bucharest"
 alice_event.1.d: "Alice Margatroid，A young girl who lives alone on the outskirts of Bucharest is just a technician who runs a shop that repairs furniture and cars. Sometimes she also works as a tailor and performs puppet shows for children in community theatres. She always wears blue, white and red clothes and long skirts, very simple but always spotless. Although there are rumors that she was involved in the rebellion of the Sangvis of Ukraine in 1922, and that she once repaired cars for the Communists and made green uniforms for the Iron Guards, the rumors are rumors. Alice's quiet life may go on until Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia, a hot big shot in Romania personally knocks on the door of her house."
 alice_event.1.a: ""Come in, please""
 
 alice_event.2.t: "Margatroid's house"
 alice_event.2.d: ""Even if Vlad comes in person, the treatment is the same."Said Alice. Darnic was a little surprised by Alice's indifference, but he calmed down and got to the point as soon as possible: "Miss Alice Margatroid, I'm sure you know that the Yggdmillennia family is not interested in an ordinary tinker." Darnic scanned the various sizes and shapes of dolls in the house. "Yggdmillennia needs these dolls, or, more accurately, to manipulate the rope of these dolls." It's not easy to give full play to your talents all the time in such a small workshop. " Alice just took a sip of black tea. "I don't understand what you're saying, Mr. Darnic.". "Miss Margatroid, you need to know where you are.""
 alice_event.2.a: ""You have heard of the Death of the Upright, haven't you?""
 
 alice_event.3.t: "Alice Margatroid joint Yggdmillennia"
 alice_event.3.d: "Darnic, the patriarch of the Yggdmillennia family, recently invited a young girl whose clothes and living habits are out of tune with the people around her, a person known as the "puppeteer", Alice Margatroid. Ah, maybe it's because Darnic was humiliated by Aozaki Touko in the Clock Tower. It is difficult to say that he is looking for an opponent for Touko? But these are all rumors within Yggdmillennia. Although not trusted by other family members represented by Forvedge, Miss Margatroid began to work."
 alice_event.3.a: "This is a good thing."
 
 alice_event.4.t: "A cafe in Bucharest"
 alice_event.4.d: "Patchouli："Unexpectedly, Alice, who once refused to step out of town, moved to the city."\nAlice："Patchouli, the girl who didn't even want to go to the bathroom to leave the cellar, went to the street."\nPatchouli："Alice，I hope you understand what you're doing. Darnic is the same as Codreanu, and even the clock tower is not willing to accept him. In terms of honesty, Codreanu is even much better than him."\nAlice："It seems that Miss Remilia is not enough for you to worry about. I advise you to be careful not to be slaughtered by Vlad's fury one day."\nPatchouli："It's as difficult as ever to reason with you. I just want to remind you:""
 alice_event.4.a: ""Don't forget our agreement.""
 
 alice_event.5.t: "Formation of the engineering station"
 alice_event.5.d: "Since Darnic expanded the influence of the Yggdmillennia family in Romania and took over the production and construction of Bioroids as he wished, he tried to extend his hand even further. Since the "invitation" of Margatroid to the Yggdmillennia group, the family began to have the strength to compete with the pro-King's consortium in the industrial field. Now Darnic has a plan to set up an engineering station controlled by the Yggdmillennia Group to provide engineering support for the Romanian war machine, and Margatroid has agreed to participate in this plan."
 alice_event.5.a: "This is good"
 alice_event.5.b: "Not necessary"
 
 alice_event.6.t: "Integrate the arsenal"
 alice_event.6.d: "Darnic, in the process of expanding the Thousand Boundary Tree Group into the engineering industry, realized that he could apply to Vlad III for a "charter" on the grounds of the special needs of the Transylvanian War, so that his engineering station could be authorized to produce some weapons, which would facilitate Darnic's further plans. This would facilitate Darnic's further plans. So, what was Darnic's decision?"
 alice_event.6.a: "We must expand our influence"
 alice_event.6.b: "This will leave consequences"
 
 alice_event.7.t: "Integrate logistical systems"
 alice_event.7.d: "Due to the modest success of Darnic's engineering station, the small experimental municipality established on the outskirts of Bucharest has taken shape. The Thousand Realms Tree group now has the ability to continue developing the engineering station, allowing it to take over important logistical systems in the military. This is certainly beneficial for increasing the influence of the Thousand Boundary Tree, but there is no doubt that it will also touch the interests of some in the military."
 alice_event.7.a: "It is necessary to do so."
 alice_event.7.b: "Forget about it."

 alice_event.8.t: "Integrate Bucharest Power"
 alice_event.8.d: "Miss Margatroid, who seems to be quite knowledgeable about electromechanical control, believes that integrating the electrical systems of Bucharest and the surrounding area into the Thousand Boundary Tree Engineering Station will improve the efficiency of both the bionic technology equipment and the electrical system itself. This is still the first plan initiated by this engineer of few words, but accepting her proposal would mean more costly investment and might trigger discontent on the part of the palace."
 alice_event.8.a: "But it's worth it."
 alice_event.8.b: "What does she know about electrical systems?"

 alice_event.9.t: "Building an armor research center"
 alice_event.9.d: "The Goliath remote-controlled tank designed by Alice Margatroid seems to have been a great success, and although it still requires a long wire to control, the remote-controlled tank has been able to successfully perform some difficult demolition tasks. Now the Vrvej siblings are proposing to expand our reach by establishing an armored research institute at the Thousand Boundary Tree engineering station, and this will also have a positive impact on our war with Hungary."
 alice_event.9.a: "Haha, good."
 alice_event.9.b: "Don't burden yourself"
 
 alice_event.10.t: "Reincarnation"
 alice_event.10.d: "Alice Margatroid seems to be nothing more than an elegantly subdued but somewhat eccentric engineer since she's been in residence. She always seemed to have a disdain for Darnic Preston, but also reliably single-handedly built a series of advanced engineering platforms for the Thousand Boundary Tree Group. But that's where Darnic Preston miscalculated. While he was obsessed with his total victory over Flanders III and the Iron Guard elements, this "engineer" stabbed him in the back. In fact, Alice Margatroyd had gained good relations with the military hierarchy when she provided the munitions design, and had planted some people in the electrical system and municipal authorities in Bucharest, in addition to Pachauri Norecki in the palace, who was also her mole. So, with the help of all the forces, Miss Margatroid successfully launched a coup d'état, occupied the experimental city of the Thousand Boundary Tree Group and commanded the garrison of Bucharest to declare martial law. Darnic was so clever that he lost control of Romania, which he had worked so hard for."
 alice_event.10.a: "How is it her!?"

 alice_event.11.t: "The Bucharest Trial"
 alice_event.11.d: "As key figures in the Yddgmellia group declared their allegiance to Alice Margatroid, senior government officials and some high ranking members of the military also came out in support of Margatroid to "purge subversive elements and German spies". After careful consideration, Miss Margotroyd decided that in order to ensure the legitimacy of the new regime, she should not disregard the law and use widespread political violence. So she decided to use the resources at her disposal to file a lawsuit in the Bucharest court against what she declared to be a series of "traitors" and to have the entire trial broadcast nationwide by the broadcast media. \Naturally, there was no doubt about the outcome of the trial, as Darnikc Prestone was convicted in absentia on multiple counts of abuse of power, collaboration with the enemy, and embezzlement. In fact, in order to protect himself, Darnic's confidant Forvedge brother and sister testified and provided a lot of internal information of the Yddgmellia Group to confirm that Darnic had "close unofficial contacts" with Germany before the Carpathian War. Subsequently, the Iron Guard capitanul Codreanu was also tried in absentia and convicted of unlawful subversion, murder, and unlawful incitement, and some core members of the death squad were sentenced to death in court and then taken to the execution chamber. \n Also tried was General Ion Antonescu. The secret telegram exchange between Antonescu and Codreanu was presented to the judge by the prosecutor, and after the judge read out the contents of the telegram, the senior officers who came down to the courtroom to observe the trial began to whisper and discuss -- obviously, they were shocked by the incident. Subsequently, Antonescu was sentenced to life imprisonment and stripped of all military rank and honors. \n Alice Margatroid, known to the public with some fear as "the Puppeteer of Bucharest," sat in a seat at the bottom of the court and listened quietly to the trial, occasionally asking a few questions indifferently. Only those in the know knew that she had manipulated the trial."
 alice_event.11.a: "There is a surprising silence in Bucharest tonight."
 
 alice_event.13.t: "Alice Margatroid excaped"
 alice_event.13.d: "The power of [From.GetRulingPartyLong] has brought a major turning point in the political situation in Romania. On any harbinger night, Alice Margatroid detonated the Yggdmillennia laboratory she managed and fled the control area. Although the guard soldiers tried to intercept, Alice's pre-set remote control weapon successfully hindered the hunt. One day later, she jumped on the last ship that left Romania and fled the country."
 alice_event.13.a: "All in vain?"
