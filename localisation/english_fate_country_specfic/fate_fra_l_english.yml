Duke Richelieu, the minister of the navy, stepped into the door of the design bureau conference room in black leather boots, hurriedly took off his coat and high military cap, and hung it on the coat hanger at the door. Several senior Admiralty officials and design bureau engineers in the room sat around the oval table, waiting for the meeting to begin. "20 years after the end of World War I, the French navy has never been like this -" Richelieu paused, slightly closing his eyes and glancing at the crowd. "awkward." "as you already know, Italy is building a new battleship, Venetto, equipped with nine 15-inch main guns, while Bismarck, which the Germans are preparing, is said to be equipped with 15-inch guns. What about us? Not long ago, the Dunkerque had just been launched, the No. 2 turret of the Strasbourg had not been installed, and main guns of these two ships were only 330mm. If it goes on like this, not to mention being on an equal footing with the British, even the Mediterranean will lose control. That's what I came back from Indochina last month to solve. I've met with Queen Mary, who supports the navy's expansion plan, and the Ministry of Finance has approved funding under the project code PN-196. So your task today is to find a feasible new capital ship programme to regain French hegemony in the Mediterranean. ""

What do you think? “ “Battleships are the main force in future naval battles, and now it is obvious that our capital ships must be able to effectively protect against attacks by 15-inch guns. If this standard is not met, our front lines will become fragile in a decisive battle. An Admiralty official said slowly, "first of all, we must figure out what our strategic purpose is."Another naval officer stood up and went to the huge map of Europe hanging on the wall. "We are not going to fight a decisive battle at sea with the large-scale British fleet, our main purpose is to control the Mediterranean and attack the maritime lines of Italy. Only the capital ships with high speed can achieve this goal. In addition, our ships have to face the threat of torpedoes and aircraft, which also reflects the necessity of high speed. And now that our country's finances are tight, the relatively cheap battlecruisers are the most suitable choice. Current technology can completely achieve high-speed battleships, as long as the layout is reasonable." "Have you forgotten the lesson of the Battle of Jutland? " Another general retorted. The discussion became more and more heated, and in the end, the consensus was that--"

 fn.3.t: "Project PN-196——Main Battery"
 fn.3.d: ""Considering the current situation, we should also choose the caliber of the 15-inch main gun. The most critical problem is that there are now two layout schemes: one is to continue to use the Dunkerque-class two front quadruple batteries, and the other is to return to the traditional three triple batteries. ""The advantage of the quadruple main gun is that the firepower is further concentrated, the main armor belt is effectively shortened, and the weight of the ship is greatly reduced, so more remaining design weight can be used for the power part and the air defense part. The defect is that the technology of our quadruple turret is not very mature, and its reliability will be affected to a certain extent. at the same time, the distance between the guns is too close, and the wakes interfere with each other when the projectile comes out of the chamber, resulting in trajectory deviation and increasing the walking surface. And because there are only two turrets, if one is destroyed in battle, the combat effectiveness of the whole ship will be greatly reduced. To solve this problem, armored bulkheads need to be set up in the quadruple main turret to divide the turret into the left and right parts. The Dunkerque design verified that this scheme is effective." An engineer explained the technical details in detail."

The 152mm gun used on our cruiser has proved to be so successful that it can be modified to a new battleship. " "these guns should be arranged in separate turrets, powered by hydraulically driven motors and RPC. And the guns should be able to be loaded at any angle and equipped with three projectile lifting systems, one for surface projectiles, one for anti-aircraft projectiles, and one for cartridges so that weapons can be quickly switched between different types of projectiles.

The most advanced 13.5-meter large rangefinder should be equipped in the main gun firing command tower, and the 8-meter rangefinder should also be installed in the main gun firing backup command tower. after the main command tower is damaged, the standby command tower can take over its duties. Each main turret needs to be equipped with a 14-meter rangefinder and a secondary turret with an 8-meter rangefinder. Each main/secondary turret must be equipped with an independent observation system to ensure that the commander can still shoot independently after being damaged. All fire control rangefinders, including those inside the turret, need to be combined. " "the British took the lead in using radar devices on warships, and we must not lag. Since the current domestic radar technology is not accurate enough to provide firing parameters for fire control, the new capital ship should at least install centimeter wave sea search radar and air search radar to ensure that close large surface ship targets and low altitude targets within 30 miles can be detected. " "shipborne aircraft play a vital role in spying on the enemy and correcting the impact point of the projectile, and the new capital ship should be designed to carry two to three Loire-Newport 130 seaplanes and two catapults.""

Is it a holiday today? No, but it may be just as significant, because today, France's newest battleship, the Richelieu, is about to unfold her legend. To celebrate the launching of the world's most advanced warship, many celebrities flocked to the celebration, while it was the royal motorcade driving slowly in the middle of the road. Jeanne d'Arc stood in the back seat of the car, constantly waving to the crowd, her long flowing blond hair and warm smile on her delicate face made her particularly holy. Next to the saint, it was the dignified and elegant queen, Marie Antoinette, whose slender and graceful body was wrapped in a gorgeous white bare-shouldered dress, revealing her back skin as delicate and smooth as velvet silk, and under her smart and leaping eyebrows, the beautiful blue eyes were as sweet and cheerful as the Paris Champs Elysees at night. At this time, the apple of the palm, as a symbol of France, talked excitedly with the crowd, and her lovely and innocent face glowed as warm as the sun. Not far from the dock, the majestic Richelieu was solemnly moored, eight huge main guns were lifted into the sky, and countless colorful flags fluttered on the mainmast, like an epic hero."

After the explosion, the deck of the battleship Richelieu burst into flames, and two guns were completely damaged. after timely fire fighting and emergency repair, the main body of the ship was not seriously injured. According to unknown sources, the cause of the accident seems to be related to the substandard quality of the projectiles used. The military has not issued any clarification on the accident.

 fn.13.t: "Project PN-196 The 2nd Battleship"
 fn.13.d: "With the formal start of the development of the weapons of the No. 1 warship of the PN-196 program, more and more problems are gradually exposed. The most serious problem is that the elevation angle of the 152mm  secondary gun used in the No. 1 warship can not reach 90 degrees of the predetermined target, and after the efforts of a large number of engineers, it can only reach 75 degrees at most. On the other hand, the elastic loading system matched with it is not mature, and the ROF is low, but it can not be maintained. At the same time, the rotation and pitching speed of the turret is not up to standard, so it is impossible to track fast-moving air targets. These problems meant that the gun could not complete the scheduled air defense mission, causing the six new 37mm automatic anti-aircraft guns of the No. 1 ship to become the only medium-range air defense weapons. Weak air defense capability has become the deadliest weakness of the new first-class capital ship. In order to make up for these defects, for the No. 2 warship that is about to start, we must find a way to modify the original design as soon as possible. Duke Richelieu has summoned Admiralty officials and Design Bureau engineers to discuss improvements to the No. 2 ship. Time is running out, it is difficult for us to make major changes to the overall layout, we can only change some local designs, starting with secondary guns and anti-aircraft guns."

The gun uses barrel self-tightening technology, semi-automatic loading, elastic impact loading to achieve arbitrary angle loading. The twin guns share a set of pitching devices with a pitch angle of-10 to 80 degrees and fire integrated ammunition. High explosive projectiles equipped with timing fuzes and semi-armor-piercing projectiles against light targets at close range can be used with a firing speed of 10 rounds per minute. " "the 100mm gun design command tower is located on both sides of the main gun firing command tower at the top of the front tower, and all 100mm gun firing command towers should be equipped with a 3-meter rangefinder."

 fn.16.t: "37mm Auto anti-air"
 fn.16.d: "There is no doubt that the planned 37mm/70 antiaircraft gun is an excellent air defense weapon. According to the data provided by the Luenavale Artillery Research Institute, the cyclic firing rate of a single gun can reach 165172 rounds per minute. To protect the complex ammunition supply structure, they designed a dual gun seat with an open circular arc cover and introduced an RPC system to control the azimuth, which uses electricity to drive the gun seat rotation, which is the first time in the world, although the gun pitch still has to be manually controlled. Unfortunately, the development of the gun has not yet been completed, only 2 sets of samples have been produced in the workshop, and there are still many problems. According to the current progress, it is estimated that the No. 1 ship will not be equipped with this kind of anti-aircraft gun. instead, we will probably have to install the old semi-automatic 37mm/50 CAIL Model 1933 anti-aircraft gun on the No. 1 ship. I hope this gun will eventually catch up with the construction of the No. 2 ship."

Index: except for the improvement part, the other indexes are basically the same as those of the No. 1 warship. The boiler test shows that the transmission system of No. 1 and No. 2 warships is efficient and reliable, but the deficiency is that when the engine is running at medium and low power, the energy conversion rate of the engine is relatively low. therefore, the fuel consumption of economic speed is larger and the endurance is poor.

According to the strategic deployment of the Admiralty, the Richelieu was incorporated into the French East Atlantic Fleet as the flagship, responsible for the security of the northern French coastline and the control of the eastern Atlantic waters, with Bretagne as its home port. Jean.Bart, the flagship of the French Mediterranean Fleet, is tit-for-tat with the Italian navy and is responsible for the struggle for sea power in the entire Mediterranean region, with its homeport in Casablanca, Morocco.

The enemy ship distance and azimuth data, self-speed tilt data, and projectile deviation observation data are converged from their respective communication routes to the information processing module, which are solved into gun pointing and pitching data by the fire control computer, which are guided to each turret. At the same time, the use of the RPC system enables the calculated firing parameters to be directly realized by electric and hydraulic pressure, without the need for azimuth hand adjustment in the turret. " "the new microwave surface search radar operates at a frequency of 3000 MHz and can find large warships within 15 nautical miles.

 fn.10.d: "The preliminary A and B series proposals were submitted to the Duke of Richelieu for approval. Since the Navy wanted to start the construction of the No. 3 ship as soon as the No. 1 ship was launched, the Duke finally chose the A2 case, which was questioned, as the basis for the design of the No. 3 ship. The improved B3 TER project was selected as the basis for the design of the No. 4 warship with relatively plenty of time. The final design of the No. 3 warship continues the layout of the A2 case, which is similar to that of the No. 1 warship as a whole, and mainly adjusts the layout of secondary guns. The improvements are as follows: keep the secondary gun, cancel one secondary turret at the stern and change it to two knapsack layouts. This ingenious design provides additional control space for the new anti-aircraft gun and limits the weight gain to only about 50 tons. After the removal of the four twin 100mm turrets on both sides of the tower, the remaining two 100mm turrets are lightened to ensure that the weight of the superstructure does not exceed the standard, and after it is moved to the No. 2 main turret, the number of 37mm anti-aircraft guns remains unchanged, but the position is adjusted accordingly. However, this design relatively limits the firing range of the No. 2 main turret, which will be reduced from 286 degrees to 278 degrees when the two anti-aircraft guns are fired. On the other hand, all new 100mm guns are equipped with 30mm armour to protect against shrapnel and muzzle storms. In addition, minor adjustments are made to the front armor of each secondary gun to offset the increase in the center of gravity brought about by the knapsack layout."
 fn.10.a: "I, navy, Rich！"

 fn.11.t: "The No. 4 ship"
 fn.11.d: "The B3 ter programme is an almost brand-new design and has been widely praised by the Admiralty. Its innovation lies in the average placement of the two main turrets at the front and rear of the ship, making up for the firepower behind the ship. The front 2 and rear 1 of the secondary gun is arranged on the central axis, which can also provide the firepower of 9 doors on one side. Both 100mm anti-aircraft guns and 37mm anti-aircraft guns have increased from 6 to 8. All anti-aircraft guns are installed on the side of the open firing boundary, which is far away from each other, and each group is controlled by a controller, so that there is less interference with each other, and the efficiency of air defense is significantly improved. The front two knapsack layout 152mm secondary guns can also provide strong support for the forward direction of the greater threat of torpedo strikes. The armored area of the whole ship is only less than 4 meters longer than the No. 1 ship, and thanks to a reasonable layout, the weight has been reduced by 360 tons. The final design scheme of the No. 4 warship follows the basic layout of the B3 ter case, but the difference lies in that the catapult is moved back to the stern, the layout of the new battleship of the US military is adopted, and the hangar is placed longitudinally inside the ship, which solves the problem that the firing of the original main gun affects the anti-aircraft gun. The protection of the secondary gun is further strengthened compared with the No. 3 ships and the front, side, top, and gun seat armor have been improved to a certain extent. As the secondary turret is reduced by 1 compared with the No. 3 warship, the exposed chimney above the main deck is also allowed to enhance protection from 20mm to 30mm. As a result of the increase in air defense weapons, the number of small boats of the No. 4 ship has been reduced from 17 to 12 compared with that of the No. 3 ship."

However, in order to obtain the armor-piercing effect similar to that of the 406mm gun, the new 380mm main gun barrel is lengthened to 50 times the diameter and lightweight, which is incorporated into the radar fire control system and equipped with a delay firing device of 0.06s, which can first allow the first and third guns on the turret to fire, which significantly reduces the influence of muzzle storm on walking. The new warship selects the 3x4 joint main gun design in plan 3, using the 'front 2 and rear 1' layout, which greatly increases the firepower delivery compared with the 'Richelieu' class. On the other hand, the firing speed of 12 guns is faster than that of 8 guns. In the same round of calibrating shots, the Richelieu class battleship can only fire two and a half shots in a short period of time, while the new ship can fire three and a half shots.

The secondary ammunition depot is located in a separate compartment in the rear armored area and is located in the front of the main gun ammunition depot, from where the ammunition will be transported directly to the turret. Thanks to the extension of the hull, the side is equipped with the newly developed 100mm/55 Model 1940  dual-purpose gun, which can be regarded as a growth version of model 1933. The barrel uses a self-tightening integral type, with a semi-automatic sliding wedge locking machine, the firing speed, range, and power have been improved, and the number has increased from 8 to 12, divided into front and rear groups arranged on both sides of the ship. The number of 37mm anti-aircraft guns has also increased to 12, of which four are arranged between the front and rear groups of 100mm anti-aircraft guns, and the other eight are arranged on both sides of the 152mm secondary guns between the No. 2 (3) main turret and the front (rear) tower. The fire control of the 100mm  dual-purpose gun is assisted by four command and rangefinders along the side of the superstructure, while the fire control of the 37mm anti-aircraft gun is controlled by a controller for every two sets. Similar to the layout of 'Gascogne', this design effectively reduces the interference between anti-aircraft guns and improves the efficiency of air defense, and a large number of anti-aircraft guns form a dense firepower network, making the air defense capability of the new ship more powerful than ever before. The dual-purpose ammunition depot is located directly below the armored deck and the gun seat between the boiler and the engine room, in the armored area, while the ammunition of the 37mm anti-aircraft gun is stored in the ammunition depot below the armored deck and immediately below the gun seat."

Due to intelligence errors, the whereabouts of the aircraft carrier Joffre and the 17th escort formation escorted by it were detected by Nordic reconnaissance aircraft patrolling the sea. Germany immediately sent a large number of bombers and several ships in an attempt to destroy the aircraft carrier. Although Joffre sent three groups of fighters to intercept, the escort of German aircraft made it impossible for French fighters to take into account the bomber fleet. The first round of airstrikes flew over the Joffre, and under the ship's flexible evasion, the German attack did not work, but a destroyer escorted was hit by a torpedo and sank. The Naval Command received a request for help from the captain of the 'Joffre' and found that the only battleship that could arrive in the nearby sea area in a short time was the battleship Alsace, which happened to pass by this area while returning to Hong Kong to refuel after the mission. After receiving the order of reinforcements, the battleship Alsace resolutely went to the rescue and successfully arrived before the second round of airstrikes. At the beginning of the air raid, the powerful air defense firepower of 'Alsace' immediately shot down several dive bombers, and the dense fire network composed of dozens of anti-aircraft guns caught the German plane off guard and made it difficult to approach. On the other hand, the German ship was surprised to find that a battleship had joined the battlefield and mistakenly thought that French reinforcements had arrived, so it decided to give up the pursuit. In the end, the carrier "Joffre" successfully broke away from the battlefield. After the war, French Admiral Darren commented, "Alsace's rescue operation was decisive and brave.

At that time, the Duke of Richelieu rejected these proposals on the grounds that it was not appropriate to violate international conventions and damage France's international reputation. However, when French intelligence personnel learned that Germany was secretly preparing the 'H' plan, Navy Minister Richelieu could no longer ignore the potential threat and immediately met with Admiral Darren, Defense Minister Bradamante, Prime Minister Leo B Harvey, and others to discuss coping strategies, and finally came up with the plan to build a new first-class battleship, which was later known as the 'Alsace' class battleship. What was unknown at the time, however, was that there was a secret backup plan in addition to the plan, which was approved by the Supreme Council and signed by Queen Marie herself. Of the financial allocation in 1940, 5.6 billion francs was the "wartime emergency reserve", which was officially used for the procurement of German and French war equipment, but the real whereabouts of the money was known to only a few people at that time.

With a total weight of more than 4000 tons, the new gun is the heaviest turret in the world. The rotation of the turret and the pitching of the barrel are driven by electricity and hydraulic pressure, and the firing is directly controlled by the RPC system controlled by the central fire control system. The two guns on both sides of the turret have independent ammunition depots and projectile lifting mechanisms, which can be pitched independently, and there are also two 90mm artillery firing flares on both sides of each turret to enhance the night combat capability. The hooded armor-piercing projectile weighs 1320 kilograms and is 200cm long, which is longer than the overweight projectile used by American battleships. The super-long projectile gives it excellent aerodynamic shape, making the trajectory farther and more stable. The SD23' propellant, which weighs up to 364kg per shot, enables the projectile to reach an initial velocity of 810m / s, giving it the world's strongest vertical armor erosion and the longest range. In actual tests, the gun eroded 582mm of vertical armor at 20000 (30000) meters. However, the high charge also shortens the life of the gun barrel, about 190 rounds. In order to alleviate the influence of the muzzle storm of the 4-equipped main gun on walking, the gun is equipped with a 0.06-second delay firing device, which allows the first and third guns to fire first, and a gyro stabilizer is installed at the same time, which significantly reduces the gun walk. the improved projectile system also enables the firing speed to reach 2.2 rounds per minute, which is the same as that of the American-made 16-inch naval gun."

The gun adopts a double-mounted CAD, turret with a rotation speed of 25 degrees per second, and is equipped with a vertical wedge semi-automatic latch and an electric projectile rod to be loaded with a lifting machine. it can be filled at any angle and the firing speed is as high as 20 rounds per minute. Because the double diameter is larger than the American 127mm mk12 naval gun, the initial velocity of the projectile can reach 870m/ s, the range is longer, the trajectory is more stable, and the lethality is stronger. When carrying out the air defense mission, the gun is guided by the new air defense fire control radar and commanded by the RPC system and fires a high explosive bomb of a radio proximity fuze with a maximum range of 12000 meters at an elevation of 70 degrees, so that it can effectively intercept high-speed flying targets at speeds of up to 800km/h. When firing armor-piercing projectiles against ships, the initial velocity is 855m/s, and the maximum range is 18000 meters. Extremely high firing speed and accuracy can also cause great damage to small and medium-sized warships close by. On the other hand, due to the increase in the weight and volume of 127mm  dual-purpose guns, the new ship is expected to be equipped with 16 guns of this type, with eight double assemblies divided into front and rear four groups arranged on both sides of the ship's hull, one for each group under the command of one fire control radar."

Horizontal protection consists of three layers, the first layer is 36mm deck armor, the second layer is 100mm main horizontal armor, and the third layer is 15mm fragment partition. The main turret is protected by front 330mm, side 180mm to 200mm, top 150mm, rear-end 200mm, seat 330mm. To reduce weight, the secondary turret protection is lightweight and the front is reduced from the Richelieu class 130mm to the 116mm. The front and top of the command tower armor are 300mm and 130mm respectively. Due to the limited width and weight of the ship, the underwater protection adopts the triple bottom protection of the French battleship in the same period, but the torpedo protection compartment is reduced to 1, and the protection capability is between the battlecruiser and the heavy cruiser."

The 152mm gun is assembled with four seats and three seats, of which one is in the front, which is carried behind the No. 2 main turret and three in the rear and is arranged in the shape of goods. The advantage of this layout is to maintain the firepower of 9 secondary guns on one side, shorten the length of the armored box as much as possible, and save space for the arrangement of anti-aircraft guns. The 100mm  dual-purpose gun is assembled with 8 seats and 2, and the front and rear groups are arranged on both sides of the ship hull, with the 100mm gunfire controller in the middle. The 37mm anti-aircraft gun is assembled with 8 seats, of which 2 are located on both sides of the front secondary gun, 2 on both sides of the front tower, and 4 on both sides of the rear tower, each of which is controlled by a controller. The 152mm vice-artillery ammunition depot is located in a separate compartment behind the main gun ammunition depot, the 100mm  dual-purpose ammunition depot is located directly under the gun seat between the boiler and the engine room, and the ammunition of the 37mm anti-aircraft gun is stored in the ammunition depot below the armored deck, and all ammunition depots are placed in the armored area.

During the grand launching ceremony, the No.1 was officially named Jeanne d'Arc, and like the saint who saved the critical situation in French history, the French navy hoped that when the war came to its most critical moment, she would be able to protect the precarious shipping lines in the waters of northern France. After a short trial, Jeanne joined the French Northern United Fleet as the leader of the 7th Cruise Fleet. In just a few months, she became a nightmare for all enemy cruiser commanders, and even if they saw her haughty main mast from a distance, they had to immediately choose to pull smoke to escape, or else they had to be sunk by the powerful 305mm main gun.

The military had expected to build a regular aircraft carrier with a standard displacement of 25000 tons in the late 1930s, drawing on the operational experience of the Béarn. However, because France's imaginary enemy, Germany, was restricted by the Versailles Peace Treaty, bound by the Washington Naval Treaty, and France's financial difficulties, the French Navy gave up building aircraft carriers. Until 1936, the French navy still had only one aircraft carrier, and the ship also found many defects in its operation for many years, and the vigorous development of aircraft carriers by the United States and Japan also made the French navy gradually realize the important position of carriers in future naval warfare. As Germany became more and more disobedient to the Versailles treaty, the French navy began to reconsider the ship-building plan of the new aircraft carrier, and they put forward two options: one is to convert the original Ducken-class cruiser into a light carrier; the other is to build two 18000-ton neutral aircraft carriers. However, when the French authorities learned not long ago that the German navy had begun to build a Zeppelin class aircraft carrier, they immediately abandoned their previous idea and decided to start building a truly large aircraft carrier to counter Germany's actions and regain maritime superiority, codenamed 'PA-16''."

The superstructure of the ship adopts an integrated island design, and the inclined chimney, mast, and bridge are integrated and placed on the starboard side of the hull, which can effectively reduce the problems such as smoke and turbulence on the rear deck. this new design has been fully verified in the Dunkerque class battleship. In order to adapt to the complex sea conditions of the Atlantic Ocean, the ship creatively uses a closed bow, which has also become a major feature of the shape. The ship has a total length of 232.5 meters and a width of 33.1m, of which the flight deck is a single one with a length of 229.7 meters, with a double-deck hangar, which can accommodate up to 84 carrier-based aircraft, and is equipped with three elevators at the front, middle and rear of the deck to improve take-off efficiency. there are two catapults on the bow flight deck and a stop cable is arranged at the front and rear of the deck. In terms of armor, the ship is positioned to defend against light cruisers, air-dropped bombs and air-dropped torpedoes. The specific design is: waterline armor 63.5mm to 105mm, can resist 152mm artillery, deck armor 40 mm, and add a layer of 70mm armor above the hangar to prevent the bomb from penetrating into the key hangar and the lower armory, underwater protection is triple bottom protection, and there are several torpedo protection compartments and watertight compartments, with the main armored belt to protect torpedo attacks.

This type of artillery is also installed on the 'Dunkerque' class battleship with a maximum elevation of 75 degrees and a firing speed of 13-15 rounds per minute. There are two at the front of the island and two at the rear of the island, with a total of four double-mounted 37mm/70 Model 1935 automatic anti-aircraft guns, and another 20 12.7mm anti-aircraft cannon are arranged all over the ship's hull. As the development of the new 37mm full-automatic anti-aircraft gun by the Luenavale Artillery Research Institute has not been successful, if the research and development of the gun is not completed on time, the old semi-automatic 37mm/50 CAIL Model 1933 anti-aircraft gun will be used instead. With the progress of radar technology, the detection capability has been improved by leaps and bounds. like the planned new battleship, the ship uses fire control radar to assist in detecting targets, uses fire controllers to calculate the parameters of distance, speed, and altitude, and guides anti-aircraft guns to aim automatically.

The placement of the keel of the first ship 'Joffre' began soon, but due to the shortage of large docks in China, after the launch of 'Joffre', the construction of the No. 2 ship 'Pandraway' could begin in the same dock, as did the construction plan of No. 3 ship 'Pétain'. The Joffre was launched under the auspices of Admiral Jean de LaPolde, a pioneer of French naval aviation and a former captain of France's first aircraft carrier, the Beyain. After several months of trial voyage, the 'Joffre' was incorporated into the second Special mixed formation of the French Northern Joint Fleet and deployed at the naval base of Calais. During this period, she participated in several important maritime military exercises, accumulating valuable experience for the tactical command and operation of the French naval air force, and it was precisely in these exercises that the French naval air force established the established standard of the aviation brigade, which consists of 30 fighters, 36 dive bombers (divided into two squadrons) and 18 torpedo bombers. The experience of modern naval warfare shows that compared with battleships, aircraft carriers have unparalleled advantages in mobility, reconnaissance capability and large-scale attack capability.

While reviewing the shipbuilding plan, Duke Richelieu, the minister of the navy, found that the number of French naval aircraft carriers was too small and that the new fleet aircraft carriers might not be in service for a long time. So she asked for the rapid expansion of a number of light aircraft carriers based on the hull of cruisers. As a result, the French navy accelerated the design of new heavy aircraft carriers on the one hand and began to study light aircraft carriers the size of cruisers on the other. Although designers have proposed that this modified aircraft carrier will have many safety and seaworthiness restrictions, such as re-laying the hangar deck above the original deck of the cruiser will raise the ship's center of gravity and cause lack of stability, the weak hangar armor will cause hidden dangers to the hangar and hull strength, and the narrow flight deck will make it more difficult for carrier-based aircraft to take off and land, but the dangerous situation does not allow any hesitation. Soon Queen Mary ordered approval to convert six of the Bayard class light cruisers being developed and planned for construction into light aircraft carriers. Concentrate your wisdom and overcome difficult problems.' The Duke Richelieu said in a letter of encouragement to designers."

Hangars, flight decks and islands mean a significant increase in the weight of the upper hull, resulting in a significant increase in the center of gravity. In order to solve this problem, the Navy decided to set up torpedo protection protrusions on both sides of the slender hull of the original cruiser, which can not only increase the buoyancy and stability of the ship, but also set up heavy oil tanks inside it to increase the endurance of the warship. at the same time, it can also enhance the ability to resist torpedo attacks. The modified light aircraft carrier is equipped with two lifts, which are arranged before and after the hangar, and equipped with a hydraulic catapult. In terms of armor protection, the 130mm waterline armor of the original cruiser can provide effective protection against 152mm guns, but in order to reduce the weight of the upper part of the ship, the hangar armor is thin, only 50mm, and the flight deck is made of wood with a layer of very light armor attached to it. The level of underwater protection is to add a torpedo protection bag on the basis of the original cruiser, which can defend against the attack of air-dropped torpedo to a certain extent. The power system uses six Andre boilers and four turbine engines, which can provide 100000hp for the aircraft carrier."

Besides, 10 double-mounted 20mm anti-aircraft guns are installed throughout the hull to form a tight short-range air defense network. On the shipboard electrical system, the ship is equipped with a new type of surface detection radar with an accuracy of 300 yards and a resolution of 400 yards. it can detect large ships within 16 nautical miles or destroyers within 12 nautical miles, and the new air search radar can detect seaplanes at a height of 10000 feet within 70 nautical miles or fighters of similar height within 50 nautical miles."

The unarmored flight deck is easy to be pierced by the aircraft bomb, which enters the hangar directly, which is very dangerous to the aircraft carrier, and after the flight deck is destroyed, the aircraft carrier cannot take off and land, and the aircraft carrier cannot fight. Although there is still a weak possibility of taking off and landing aircraft after the lift is destroyed, the combat capability of the aircraft carrier will also be greatly reduced. In order to deal with the attacks of a large number of land-based aircraft from Germany and Italy and improve the viability of aircraft carriers, the French navy decided to design a new class of heavily armored aircraft carriers with reference to the characteristics of British 'brilliant' class aircraft carriers. On the other hand, the prowess of aircraft carriers in the Atlantic Ocean has also made the Navy determined to speed up the construction of aircraft carriers. The combination of the two factors led to a new plan for the expansion of a large aircraft carrier. Thanks to the Queen's strong support, and following a fierce quarrel in the Supreme Council, the Navy finally won funding for four new aircraft carriers.

The flight deck is directly involved in the hull composition, which is covered with 76mmCNC armor and reinforced with 114mm armor above the key ammunition depots, which enables the Fuxu class to withstand 1000-pound aerial bomb attacks. Of course, the heavy armor also brings a disadvantage, that is, the center of gravity is on the high side, and the stability of the hull has decreased, so the freeboard height of the ship is lower than that of Joffre class, to alleviate this problem. To ensure that the carrier-based aircraft have armored protection at the shortest take-off and landing distance, the ship does not use the front, middle and rear lift design, but uses two larger front and rear lifts. Not only maintain efficient take-off and landing efficiency but also different from the 'brilliant' class unprotected lift, the ship's lift is covered with two pieces of 25mm armor, which plays a certain role in protecting the fragile lift. Another design highlight of the ship's protection is that the hangar has storm discharge holes and detachable steel plates, which helps to alleviate the hull damage caused by the explosion of the armored aircraft carrier hangar. The waterline armor has also been strengthened to 114 mm to provide better protection for the hull. The underwater protection maintains the 'Joffre' design, and the torpedo protection bulkhead is slightly thickened.

To gain an overwhelming advantage over German heavy cruisers, the French navy decided to develop a new type of 240mm rapid-fire main gun. The new gun was originally planned to be installed on the St. Louis class heavy cruiser, but it was calculated that the new turret was so heavy that the ship's hull needed a major overhaul.

In the past, the sub-loading projectile used by naval guns is helpful to control the range and power, but the firing speed is too slow. To improve the firing speed, the new main gun adopts fixed loading and automatic loading system for the first time. The gun pitch and rotation are all electrically driven, which can be loaded at any angle and can be fired into the air. It uses an air tank to provide air pressure to open and close the latch. It takes only 8 seconds to load and can fire at an astonishing speed of 8 shots per minute. The gun is the first batch of artillery developed by the French navy to use sliding gaskets. The gun body uses a self-tightening integral type, the chrome-plated sliding gasket is fixed by a gasket locking ring, and the wedge-shaped vertical sliding tail block is used instead of the traditional intermittent screw. when using a heavy charge, the initial velocity of the projectile can reach 845m / s, and the maximum range can reach 36km at an elevation of 40 degrees. The new ship plans to be equipped with nine of this type of artillery, three combined with three pieces of artillery, and a layout of "front, second and rear one". Due to the use of a complex automatic loading system and thicker armor, the weight of the turret is significantly higher than that of the 'St. Louis' class, each weighing 730 tons.

The gun adopts a double-mounted CAD, turret with a rotation speed of up to 25 degrees per second, and is equipped with a vertical wedge semi-automatic latch and an electric push rod to be loaded with a lifting machine. it can be loaded at any angle and the firing speed is as high as 20 rounds per minute. The gun is guided by a new type of air defense fire control radar and commanded by the RPC system. When carrying out air defense tasks, it uses radio proximity fuze high explosive projectiles, and the initial velocity of the projectiles can reach 870m / s. When firing at ships, it fires armor-piercing projectiles with an initial velocity of 855m / s and a maximum range of 18000 meters. In terms of medium-range air defense, the ship uses a more powerful 57mm/60 Model 1943 anti-aircraft gun to replace the original 37mm gun. The new anti-aircraft gun is installed in a double-mounted ACAD. The turret weighs 18 tons and uses 2.96kg (6.5lb) heavy projectiles with an initial velocity of 850m / s, a firing speed of 120m / min, a maximum range of 14500 m, and a maximum range of 5500 m at a muzzle elevation of 90 degrees. The anti-aircraft gun is controlled by the new DRBC- 30B radar fire control director and can track the target automatically. To face a greater air threat, the ship is expected to install six dual-mounted 127mm/54  guns (on both sides of the front and rear hull) and eight 57mm/60 anti-aircraft guns (on both sides), as well as several new radars to detect targets and guide fire control."

All three ships are scheduled to start construction at the Brest Naval Base Shipyard, of which the first ship 'Henry IV' took a year to complete and joined the sixth Special Task Force formation of the Northern Joint Fleet as a flagship. Her birth will completely change the battle pattern of cruisers, with nine powerful 240mm quick-firing guns, her firepower is more than the sum of two ordinary heavy cruisers, which allows her to face a small broken fleet alone, and excellent air defense firepower makes her perfectly qualified for the escort mission of aircraft carriers.

 fn.60.d: "When the Washington Naval Treaty was concluded in 1922, the French navy went to great lengths to acquire only 35% of the number of major ships held by Britain, like its potential rival Italy. For the French navy, which has a long tradition, it has to accept this figure, because weak finances and shortage of supplies make it impossible for it to compete for expensive main ships. After the Treaty of Versailles, the French navy learned a lot from the Germans, especially in the case of large destroyers, and successfully combined them with their ships. the result is that the French navy's destroyer leader is one of the most powerful destroyers. However, the good times are not long, the Italians are getting closer and closer, and they want to use light cruisers to hunt down the destroyer leader, which makes the French urgently need an upgraded destroyer leader so that the French navy will not waver."

Therefore, they come up with new solutions. Compared with the previous scheme, the armament is reduced by 1 main gun and increased by 1 torpedo. At the final meeting, the votes were the same. Now, the decision is in Richelieu's hands."

Its outdated alcohol-air heating propulsion mode greatly limits the range and speed of the torpedo. To meet the needs of the new destroyer in torpedo operations, the French Navy decided to develop a new torpedo powered by a hot and humid air engine, the principle of which is to inject liquid water into the combustion chamber after ignition, cool the cylinder and produce more gas at the same time, to make full use of heat to propel the torpedo. With the support of this propulsion mode, the new torpedo can reach a maximum speed of 46 knots, with a range of 3000 meters and a maximum range of 13 kilometers at 35 knots. Warhead charge 310kg TNT can pose a great threat even to large ships."

At present, France is still in the stage of recovery after the economic crisis and is no longer able to build more large ships. But there is no doubt that this powerful new destroyer has greatly improved in terms of escort ability and survivability. Now the Italians have to redesign a new ship to fight this sword. The French can guarantee that when the Italians launch a new light cruiser, they will have to face a new large destroyer again. This time it is the French who take the lead, while the Italians are always the ones who follow in the footsteps of France."

Whether the former artillery destroyer faction or the torpedo destroyer faction sat back together, the previously shelved torpedo destroyer plan was put back on the agenda, replacing the 1934 main gun on the basis of the original torpedo destroyer, even if a turret was dismantled. But his firepower is still greater than the previous artillery destroyer fantasy. The speed is designed as usual for 39 knots, with 4 twin main guns, 4 triple 21.7 inch torpedo tubes, 2 twin 37mm anti-aircraft guns and 4 twin 20mm Erlicon anti-aircraft guns. Both the Thunder faction and the shelling faction expressed their satisfaction with this ship, and how would the Italian light cruiser react to such a destroyer?"

 fn.67.d: "In order to improve the hit rate of depth charge, the Navy R & D department reduced the projectile size and weight, and developed an anti submarine mortar with a long range and multiple salvo. There are 24 gun tubes on its launcher, which are inclined forward by 45 degrees. During volley firing, 24 hedgehog projectiles are launched one by one at a short interval to form an oval barrage. If the submarine is covered by this elliptical barrage, the submarine may be destroyed. The basic technical indexes: caliber 7 inches (178mm); projectile weight 29kg / charge 30lb TNT; range 200-259m; sinking rate 6.7-7.2m/s. Compared with depth charge, this weapon has several outstanding advantages: 1. Using trigger fuse, unsuccessful attack will not interfere with sonar; 2. It is not necessary to know the exact depth of submarine; 3. It will not let submarine find out that it is under attack; 4. Compared with depth charge, it is very light and can carry many."

 fn.68.d: "When compressed air pushes the torpedo to sail, the non-combustible nitrogen in the air will be removed directly, and a row of bubbles will flow out of the water, which may expose itself in advance. In order to solve this problem, the French navy decided to use compressed oxygen as combustion aid. The propellant burns in pure oxygen, which mainly produces slightly soluble carbon dioxide, so it is not easy to produce bubbles. As a result, the speed and range of the torpedo have also been greatly improved. the new 550mm oxygen torpedo can reach a maximum speed of 55 knots, with a range of 3000 meters, a range of 18 kilometers at 40 knots, and a maximum range of 30 kilometers at 35 knots. Due to the saving of propellant, the new torpedo charge has also been greatly improved, reaching 408 kg TNT, which is enough to cause serious damage to any enemy ship."

When the first Mogador-class destroyer was officially put into service, the confidence of admirals, the pride of researchers and workers, and the pride of the officers and men on board were the answers. The main gun of this destroyer has a firing speed of 12 rounds per minute and a speed of 43 knots! The tonnage has also reached 4000 tons of light cruiser grade! New fire control equipped with a new main gun, whether in the face of destroyers or cruisers, have a good performance. High mobility with the torpedo, making it a new French maritime sword, this kind of ship will seriously threaten the Italian sea supply line! That's right!

 fn.48.t: "Naval manoeuvre"
 fn.48.d: "The large-scale exercise is divided into two antagonistic fleets, one is a cutting-edge fleet with Béarn as the main force, and the other is a traditional fleet composed of battlecruiser Dunkerque. Among them, Béarn's excellent performance invigorated the Admiralty, whose aircraft broke through layer after layer of defense of the traditional fleet wheel array and directly "took" the flagship Dunkerque at the center of the enemy fleet. This incident made the French realize two things: first, the serious lack of anti-air firepower of France's existing ships; second, the importance of aircraft carriers to future naval warfare. When the French realized this, they found that they had already lagged behind Britain, the United States and Japan in these two aspects, in addition to stepping up the construction of new aircraft carriers and the study of new anti-air weapons, the transformation of old weapons is also a good way. The Navy thought of the De Grasse class, a new light cruiser that had not yet been finalized last year, and the design of the whole ship was nearing completion. Coupled with the experience of this large-scale exercise, part of De Grasse's blueprint design would be replanned."
 fn.48.a: "What kind of ship could it be?"

 fn.44.t: "De Grasse class hull"
 fn.44.d: "Because the ship is required to be designed under the framework of the London Naval Treaty, the displacement is strictly limited to less than 8000 tons, while the new ship is defined as an air defense cruiser, which is mainly used as the escort mission of the main ship, so the ship is only equipped with light armor protection. The specific design is as follows: the side waterline armored belt is 100mm, and the lower end is gradually weakened to 28mm. The horizontal protection is a single layer of 32mm dome belt covering the deck, with a layer of 32mm CNC armor attached to the ammunition depot. The front of the command tower is 75mm, and the front, side, top, rear, and seat ring of the main turret are all 32mm. Underwater protection maintains minimum double bottom protection, equipped with a torpedo compartment and many watertight compartments."

 fn.49.d: "De Grasse's initial design was 3x3 152mm main guns, but due to the lack of effective anti-air weapons, the naval department further strengthened the air defense design of Grasse. Considering that the anti-air performance of the 152mm main guns was poor and could not be competent for the outer anti-air network, the Navy Department unloaded all original 152mm guns, added one turret base, and the new main guns were 4x2 130mm/45 Mle 1935 dual-purpose guns. Due to the removal of the catapult, the number of secondary guns has been increased from 3x2 100mm/45 Mle 1930 anti-air guns to 6x2, and 6 new 37mm/70 Mle 1935 anti-air guns have been installed in the middle to replace 4 old semi-auto 37mm/50 guns, and the 13.2mm machine guns have been replaced by 24x1 20mm Oerlikon cannons, which greatly enhanced the air defense firepower."

In the end, the protection design of the new ship followed the Algeria-class system, which was comprehensively strengthened on the basis of it, and became a new protection standard for heavy cruisers after the French navy got rid of the restrictions of the treaty. The specific design is as follows: the waterline armor is 150mm, the surface hardened armor is used to peel off the armor-piercing projectile cap, the tilt is 10 degrees, and the lower end is gradually reduced to 80mm; the horizontal protection is a single layer of 70mm horizontal uniform armor deck, and the top of the ammunition depot is strengthened to 90mm.

The ship's main firepower is three triplets, with a total of nine new 203mm/55 Mle 1934 guns. The gun is 11.5 meters long and weighs 17.4 tons. The armor-piercing projectile used weighs 140 kilograms. The initial velocity can reach 844 meters per second when fired with a heavy charge, and the maximum range is 32 kilometers at a 40-degree elevation. In the actual test, the gun can penetrate 270mm vertical surface hardened armor at 10000 (20000) meters and 70mm horizontal homogeneous armor at 20000 meters. The maximum firing speed is 5 rounds/min, and it can reach 4 rounds/min in actual combat. Since the naval exercise in 1937, the French navy has attached great importance to the ability of ship air defense. The secondary gun and outer air defense firepower of the new ship adopts seven duplex 100mm/45 Mle 1933  dual-purpose guns, which have been widely used in a large number of new battleships, aircraft carriers and cruisers with good performance and high reliability. After careful study, comparison, and testing, the French navy finally chose its 37mm/70 anti-aircraft guns and imported Swiss 20mm Erlihole guns as medium-and short-range air defense weapons, equipped with a total of 6 dual 37mm/70 anti-aircraft guns and 8 twin and 12 single-mounted 20mm Oerlikon guns, so the ship's air defense capability is very excellent.
