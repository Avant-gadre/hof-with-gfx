Now he has two documents in front of him, one drafted by the Strasser brothers, listing a detailed "National Valkism" program and a profusion of state-owned economic development plans. Grigor Strasser, who is no longer in the world, wrote in the preface, "Dear Your Excellency, this document will lead to a real and great nation of people." On the right is the joint letter by the veterans headed by Anton Drexler. Here, "National Valkism" is still an abstract concept, just like the mission-oriented command of our military has never been too restrictive. The last one There is also a preface to the "Der Mythus des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts" co-written by Romanian entrepreneur and scholar Mr. Danic and our famous theorist Mr. Rosenberg, which is intended to emphasize the importance of consolidating ancient Germanic beliefs.

Strasser explains this by saying that "allegiance to German socialism is naturally equivalent to acceptance of German culture". As for practice, [SOV.GetName] as the nominal socialist leader of the poor does not mean that its ideology is useless, the Strasser brothers as the leader of the place has always been well managed, the development of its heavy industry is among the highest in the country, so now the chaos will come to the situation should be adopted as a guiding ideology."

The ideology adopted was peculiar: "Anyone who accepts German culture and learns the German language is entitled to become a German citizen. Therefore German culture must always represent the people and progress". No one can say whether it was the silent Siegfried who came up with the idea, or whether it was the rumored drunken rantings of a Czech-German veteran of the Great War named "Adam Dressler," but it seems to have been a fantasy that satisfied the majority of the people, so raise the black, white and red flag under the watchful eye of Siegfried."

However, the National Socialist faction believes that this number can continue to expand. It can try to integrate the Siegfried Jugend and Siegfried Mädel Bund and teach relevant skills to young women of the right age.

However, the current methods of disposing of the church are also different between the two factions in the party. The National Socialist faction simply wants to destroy Christianity in order to promote national atheism.

The relatively stubborn Catholic Church has only to obediently cut ties with the Vatican. Now it is time to consider building a new faith in Germany. However, for the National Socialist faction, the ancient Germanic culture is only a symbol. At the moment, it is enough to remove the atheistic state of the influence of the Christian church, but all members including the Strasser brothers dare not talk about this topic. Making a big fuss, agreeing with and admiring the new belief system with Siegfried at the core is like our country's "political correctness." "

Naturally, the current guard commander Heinrich Himmler will be happy about this and will actively stand on the side of the deceased old governor.

 more_ger.108.t: ""Mediterranean Pseudo-History Examination""
 more_ger.108.d: ""The so-called civilizations such as ancient Greece and Rome are just myths concocted by intellectuals during the Renaissance!" \n\nMr. Alfred Rosenberg, a famous cultural scholar who is also our cultural commissioner, has recently published his new work--"Mediterranean Pseudo-History Examination", according to the book's rigorous narrative and arguments, the so-called ancient Greeks and Romans were nothing but looters and According to the book's rigorous narrative and argument, the so-called ancient Greeks and Romans were merely looters who plundered and stole the culture of immigrants from the far north. The main argument of Mr. Alfred Rosenberg is that the civilization of ancient Greece and Rome actually came from the Germanic people. Since the kind of conflict between the Germanic civilization in the Far North and the barbarians in the Mediterranean, that is, the Battle of Teutonburg Forest, the civilization from the Germanic region gradually shifted southward. Rosenberg pointed out not only that the civilization of Greece and Rome came from the Germanic people, but also that the process of transferring civilization to the south was accompanied by the degeneration of civilization. That is, the perfect spirit of Germanic nobleness, valor and fortitude gradually degenerated into the selfishness, weakness and calculation characteristic of the Mediterranean people. The rise of Florentine commerce and the Renaissance in the Middle Ages made the Mediterranean intellectuals dissatisfied with their historical destiny of being a marginal civilization, and then fabricated a large number of false histories of ancient Rome and ancient Greece. \n\nRosenberg also quoted extensively from German philosophers, from Fichte and Hegel to Nietzsche. According to Rosenberg, all these philosophers had actually recognized the falsity of Greek civilization, but were forced by the pressure of European cultural circles not to speak out. Rosenberg looks extensively at Nietzsche's works The Birth of Tragedy and Thus Spoke Zarathustra for evidence, claiming that the "spirit of Dionysus" advocated by Nietzsche is actually the "spirit of Siegfried" and that Nietzsche's discussion of Wagner's opera is actually Nietzsche's discussion of Wagner's opera is a kind of flashback to criticize the Greeks' shameless act of falsifying civilization. This claim is strongly supported by Professor Heidegger, a leading expert on Nietzsche. Rosenberg incidentally criticized Karl Marx, arguing that Marxism was a conspiracy by Mediterranean civilization to try to reverse the re-emergence of Germanic civilization. \n\naturally the book was met with widespread protests and abuse from forces outside ---- especially [ITA.GetName] and [GRE.GetName] as soon as it was published. However, the truth will not be refuted by a few mockery words. In the popular German radio program "This is Germany", Dr. Goebbels personally connected with the audience to discuss the "Pseudo-History of the Mediterranean", and almost every patriotic viewer who participated in the interaction fiercely criticized the shameless remarks of the "Romans". Dr. Goebbels also connected with Mr. Ribbentrop and asked him to tell his impressions of Nero when he met him in Rome. Dr. Goebbels quotes and proves that Nero's full body attire was actually an imitation of Arminius, the Germanic leader who defeated the Romans at the Battle of Teutonic Forest, proving once again that Roman civilization was in fact an imitator and successor of Germanic civilization. \n\nAlthough the book focuses on the fact that the Mediterranean countries forged their civilization, it also consistently mentions and praises the great ancestors of the People of the Far North--the Germanic peoples. It cannot be denied that the book still has a great political value, like other works of Mr. Rosenberg, and that some high government officials, out of the need to promote our great culture and ideology, consider that it should be treated as an official publication and that a war must be declared against the cultural theft of the Latin world!"

From their point of view, the full-length clothing of the Roman emperor Nero was imitated by Arminius, the German leader who defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest; all the military writings of the Greek General Achilles were copied from Clauser Witz and Guderian; even the religious literature and paintings of the Holy See are, in their opinion, copied from the "temporarily lost" works of the Teutonic Knights.

 more_ger.111.d: "In 1919, France sent troops to the Rhineland forcibly. When the Ruhr area was about to be occupied, the weak Social Democratic government actually ordered the withdrawal of the troops! Under the leadership of Albert Schlageter, the heroic Rhineland workers began an armed struggle against French along with the local Freikorps. The workers turned on the boiler to release steam and screamed the Frenchman who was trying to occupy the factory. At this time, the ambushed Freikorps fighters immediately launched a counterattack. Although they failed to successfully repel the French army, the heroic actions of the workers and the Freikorps won a lot of support in the country and laid the foundation for the victory of the revolution in 1920. It also won the praise of Karl Radek and others from the Russian Bolsheviks. Many of the workers who did not sacrifice in the struggle joined the Reichsarbeitsdienst led by Strasser and became one of the important foundations of the VVP in the working class after the 1920 revolution. \n\nNow that our decisive battle with the Frenchman has arrived, the workers of the Reichsarbeitsdienst are no longer satisfied with fighting the German enemies only on the production line. They are going to the front line! Albert Schlageter and Anton von Arco organized three labor regiment workers to participate in the revenge battle against the French. It is worth noting that Martin Bormann, an old friend of Albert Schlegottel, is not willing to be an office politician.

Since Valkism was banned under the severe suppression of the Vaterländische Front and the Catholic Church, Austrian pro-German elements turned to challenge the "reactionary rule" of the Fatherland Front through an ideology called "national socialism". Dollfuß died in 1933, and General [AUS.GetLeader] took over his leadership position. But the rule of the Fatherland Front has been shaken. \n\nFor the "national socialist" elements, it is time to overthrow the rule of Vaterländische Front.

However, he was still dishonest in the labor reform camp and organized a group fight, resulting in 4 deaths and 75 injuries.

As the war resumed, Oskar Dirlewanger and Theodor Eicke were released again under Berger's efforts, and their VVP membership was restored.
