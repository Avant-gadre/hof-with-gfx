 ENG_special_air_service: "Special Air Service"
 ENG_special_air_service_desc: "An officer by the name of David Stirling has come up with the idea that a small commando unit might be capable of harrassing the enemy behind their lines, causing tremendous damage. Naming them an 'Air Service' has the added benefit of causing the enemy to believe they have to defend against paratroopers, too. There may well be merit to this idea."
 ENG_chiefs_of_staff_committee: "Chiefs of Staff Committee"
 ENG_chiefs_of_staff_committee_desc: "We must empower the heads of the various service branches to conduct this war as they consider is best.

 ENG_the_three_nation_solution_desc: "Cultural and religious differences are extreme across the Indian subcontinent. Already, there are antagonizations between various groupings with different loyalties.

 ENG_enforce_the_naval_treaties_desc: "It has come to our attention that certain powers have chosen to ignore the stipulations of the Washington Naval Treaty. This cannot be allowed to stand.

 ENG_enforce_the_naval_treaties_tt: "These can be used to demand that countries who have too many §YCapital Ships§! compared to us §GReduce§! their number of §YCapital Ships§!, and will give us a §YPuppet Wargoal§! if they refuse.\n"
 ENG_maintaining_the_balance_of_power: "Maintaining the Balance of Power"
 ENG_maintaining_the_balance_of_power_desc: "The strength of the Empire lies in the weakness and paralysis of Europe.

 ENG_continental_intervention: "Continental Intervention"
 ENG_continental_intervention_desc: "It is clear that we will not be able to maintain the balance of power on the European continent without acting.

 ENG_alliance_with_germany_desc: "Our interests are aligned with the Germans - while they desire hegemony of the European continent, we desire a Europe that will not threaten the British Isles while we see to our global Empire.

 ENG_organize_the_blackshirts_desc: "The success of the British Union of Fascists depends on its public image.
