 RN.1.t: "The future of the Royal Navy"
 RN.1.d: "The second London Naval Treaty redefined the pattern of world naval power. In order to maintain the status of the world's first naval power, Britain stipulated the number and tonnage of capital ships in the negotiations. This treaty will become another great victory in the history of imperial diplomacy -- the situation should have developed in this direction. Japan's withdrawal made the treaty exist in name only. The intelligence obtained by MI6 shows that the situation is grim. Our biggest hypothetical enemies Germany and Japan are secretly and vigorously building new capital ships, and our control over the world's sea power becomes precarious. What's more unpleasant is that the lights in Brittany's military port do not go out day and night, which seems to show France's determination to compete for maritime hegemony. How can we lose to the French? Twenty years ago, the respected Lord John Fisher put forward a set of plans for the construction of the future Royal Navy, aiming to build a fast mobile fleet with high speed and heavy firepower to maximize the protection of the maritime interests of the Empire and its colonies. Unfortunately, his foresight could not be truly realized due to the technology at that time. Now, following his vision, the Admiralty sorted out a detailed naval construction plan, which was submitted to Parliament for discussion by the First Sea Lord and submitted to King Arthur for review. This key proposal determines the future of imperial sea power."
 RN.1.a: "The Royal Navy is the best of this world!"
 RN.1.b: "This is CHEATING! I do not need these ships."
 
 RN.2.t: "'Royal Navy development agreement 1937'"
 RN.2.d: "Lord Fisher believes that in order to take the initiative in the fleet decisive battle, speed is the most important. The fleet with speed advantage can freely choose the battle time and obtain the overwhelming advantage in strategy and tactics. The Battlecruiser is the product under the guidance of this thought, but this is only a transition. Advances in technology have made it possible for high-speed battleships to take into account firepower, armor and speed simultaneously. In order to gain an advantage over the German new battleships, the Navy initially set the main gun index at 406mm, but combined with the current severe economic situation of the Empire, we soon realized that it was impossible to complete a sufficient number of capital ships on time under this requirement, so we chose 356mm and 381mm main guns. On the other hand, facing the potential threat from the sky, the construction of naval aviation will become another important development direction of the Royal Navy. The final construction plan includes five 35000 ton high-speed battleships (King George V class) equipped with 356mm main guns, three 35000 ton high-speed battleships (Monarch class) equipped with 381mm main guns, four large fleet aircraft carriers (Illustrious class), 10 large light cruisers (Town class), and 40 fleet destroyers (24 J/K/N class and 16 Tribal class). The ships are expected to cost £ 150 million, and be completed in the next four years..."
 RN.2.a: "It is rare for parliament to pass a bill without any quarrel."
 RN.2.b: "King Arthur seems to have a different idea."
 
 RN.3.t: "the intervention from the King"
 RN.3.d: "Although the parliament unanimously agreed on the new ship construction plan, our king did not seem fully satisfied with its contents. In the subsequent cabinet meeting, she insisted that the design of 406mm main gun should not be abandoned, on the grounds that only 406mm main gun can gain an overwhelming advantage in the artillery battle with German new battleships, and if considering the competition with the French navy, we need more powerful capital ships, although this may lead to the lack of enough capital ships to protect all routes. Oh, Holy Jesus, she's even having a contest with the goddamn French. Many people are unconvinced, but who dares to question the great King Arthur? Soon, the new amendment was issued and passed. The new amendment abolished all battleships of 356mm and 381mm main gun, and replaced them with four 42000 ton high-speed battleships (lion class) equipped with 406mm main guns. Other construction plans remained unchanged. This makes the total investment of this plan reach 170 million pounds, and we have to wait longer to obtain new capital ships. God bless our king."
 RN.3.a: "Are we still a constitutional monarchy?"
