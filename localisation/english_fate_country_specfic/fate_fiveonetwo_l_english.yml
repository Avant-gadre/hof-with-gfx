 more_britain.23.d: "If neither Germany nor France is willing to be a "civilized" country, then we must carry out the traditional continential balance of power policy.

 more_italy.3.t: "Ethiopian War Mobilization"
 more_italy.3.desc: "Under the soft and hard bubble of Emperor Nero and the helplessness of the Senate, the Italian army, no, the Roman Legion finally began to care about belonging. Ah, it was not Rome that gathered in Eritrea and Somalia, and Emperor Nero, who is loved by everyone (maybe), arrived at the Eritrean front in an S-79 bomber to cheer for the soldiers. Then she must be greeted by a neat guard of honor when she gets off the plane."
 more_italy.3.a: ""Why is there no one?？！""
 
 more_italy.4.t: "War-weary Atmosphere"
 more_italy.4.desc: "Forget it without a guard of honor. The emperor herself drove her luxury Fiat towards the garrison headquarters, and she couldn't stand what she had seen and heard along the way, even if she had always been cheeky. Not a single soldier can be seen on the front line, which is only a few kilometers from the Egyptian position. Marshal Caesar, who was sent by East Africa, received her on the camp bed in the command room. "Ah, what are you doing here?" Well, you said you couldn't see any soldiers? Ah, they didn't want to fight at all, so I ordered an indefinite holiday. Everyone probably stayed in the barracks and slept like me.""

 more_italy.6.t: "Who is shameless?？"
 more_italy.6.desc: ""Your Majesty, I suggest you first deal with the recent problem of reds. " Umberto, after all, was an aristocrat, and even though he was grabbed by the collar by the dwarf emperor in front of the dignitaries of the country, he maintained the discussion in the meeting room in an awkward manner. Nero met her opponent this time. Obviously, this wine bag and rice bag was just like her old immortal father, and she almost had a nervous breakdown here. All right, let's deal with the proposal."
 more_italy.6.a: ""I'll take care of you first!""
 more_italy.6.b: ""I'll deal with you after I finish them.""
 
 more_italy.7.t: "It's time to..."
 more_italy.7.desc: "It is these aristocrats and bureaucrats of the former Italian kingdom who are playing tricks. There is no need for proof at all. Nero knows very well that it is impossible for them to say that they have no love for this country, but why do they want to break their vested interests? The conflict between the Senate and this bunch of bastards has been going on since the restoration of Rome in 1922, and to be honest, it's a little annoying."

 more_italy.8.t: "The Libya War"
 more_italy.8.desc: "The Senoussi order in Libya has been using violence to boycott our colonial rule, er. In fact, this is also the reason why the Senate is extremely resistant to the Ethiopian war, and the consequences of opening a second front without a settlement have been verified by the Germans. General Rodolfo Graziani, who is now adept at fighting against guerrillas, is planning an offensive to defeat the insurgents, and he has specifically asked the Senate for further reinforcements, which can be met at a time when the conquest of East Africa has stalled."
 more_italy.8.a: "I'll give him whatever he wants! As long as this time doesn't fail like last time."

 more_italy.9.t: "Victory!"
 more_italy.9.desc: "General Graziani paid a lot of money to buy off a senior member of the insurgents, revealing the hideout of Omar Mukhtar, the leader of the order, and the Roman Legion finally defeated the Senoussi order in a rapid raid in the desert that combined tanks and trucks with airplanes. After being captured alive, the bandit leader Mukhtar was ordered to be hanged by General Graziani to comfort the fallen soldiers."

 more_italy.10.desc: ""Your Majesty, you can now rest assured to prepare for the war against Egypt. " "so you're admitting you're up to something?" Umberto smiled in the noisy street restaurant, forked a mouthful of tomato sauce noodles into his mouth and chewed it loudly. Nero, who was also dressed in casual clothes, took a big gulp. "your Majesty, we, the Savoy family, love this land as much as you do, and I understand that you want it to glow with the brilliance of a thousand years ago, but can today's Apennines really support the ambition of a Roman emperor?""
 more_italy.10.a: ""(chewing) how do you know if you don't try?""

 more_italy.11.t: "Recall Caesar"
 more_italy.11.desc: ""You ask me my attitude towards the Senate? " Caesar slumped his 200-kilogram fat body into a chair, and the restaurant owner saw that he didn't even have to take the menu back to the kitchen to serve. "first of all, I don't care much about the murder of me by this institution in the past, but the nature of their identity determines that it is really impossible for them to truly represent the whole of Rome, so they should naturally be abolished." "so you mean let me carry out a full-scale personal dictatorship?""
 more_italy.11.a: ""...Let's deal with the desert war first.""
 
 more_italy.12.t: "Reinforcements arrive in Libya"
 more_italy.12.desc: "The rebellion of the Senoussi order in Libya may be the real reason why the Senate boycotted the Ethiopian war. Caesar himself came to the desert front after being nodded by the emperor. General Rodolfo Graziani, the governor of Libya, greeted him at the airport. I looked around but didn't see the intended supplies."
 more_italy.12.a: ""You're not coming alone, are you?""
 
 more_italy.13.t: "The end of the colonial war"
 more_italy.13.desc: "Graziani finally realized that Caesar was Caesar even in this day and age. The news that the troops were short of supplies more than a month ago soon reached the ears of the Libyans, who tried to seize the opportunity to fight a decisive battle with the occupying forces. A few days ago, the guerrillas swarmed out and besieged the city of Cyranica with the intention of sending all the Romans to sea, but what they waited for was not an order for a general attack, but a joint statement from leader Omar Mukhtar and Caesar. It turned out that Caesar had parachuted an army of paratroopers into the guerrilla desert headquarters and miraculously persuaded Mukhtar after taking control of the situation."
 more_italy.13.a: ""First of all, how did he parachute?？！""
 
 more_italy.14.t: "Never forget why you started"
 more_italy.14.desc: ""I've long been tired of fighting and killing, and now all I care about is her and him. " In the same restaurant, Caesar nibbled up and down, left and right, with a roast chicken leg. "to tell you the truth, sometimes I think you have forgotten your original intention as much as I do. in the past, you claimed that you wanted to make everyone smile, but the mobilization of war for a long time could only make most people look sad. We all got together to build this moribund Rome. So why are you planning on a personal dictatorship? My heir, you may have to get out of the game of Thrones like me.""
 more_italy.14.a: ""So I should do？"" 
 
 more_italy.15.t: "Revive the fascist movement？"
 more_italy.15.desc: "The Nero regime naturally has the full support of the Romans, and it is true that most of the former "Italians" are not interested in reviving Rome at present, but they have to admit that they constitute the main force of the country. To change this, Nero decided to cooperate with Gabriele d'Annunzio, a poet who led fascist militias to gnaw off the Dalmatian coastline from the allies after the end of the civil nationalist movement in 1919. D'Annunzio used to be a fervent supporter of Nero, who ordered the formal annexation of the Dalmatian coastline when she came to power, but Nero eventually co-founded the new Senate with the Savoy family for practical reasons and suppressed the civil radical movement."
 more_italy.15.a: "Just go find him." 
 more_italy.15.b: "There's only someone else."  
 
 more_italy.16.t: "A meeting with Gabriele d'Annunzio"
 more_italy.16.desc: ""Your Majesty, if you are all right, please go back."Gabriele d'Annunzio sat on the other side of the sofa buried in his papers, seemingly uninterested in Nero on one side. But the whole Apenning knew that this guy was a famous old pervert, and the light from the corner of his eye was hitting the lower part of Nero's neck, which could not be covered by men's clothes, so Nero, of course, leaned over to let him have a good look in the face of this kind of person. Unexpectedly, what he was looking at was the Carnaro Charter, which was the program document of the past march into Fum. "I know your Majesty will come to me again one day, so should the rule of the Senate come to an end?""
 more_italy.16.a: ""Yes, I will end them this time. So have you seen enough?!"" 

 more_italy.17.t: "A meeting with Balbo"
 more_italy.17.desc: "In the end, instead of stepping into Gabriele d'Annunzio's villa on the banks of Lake Garda, Nero turned and drove to the Roman Air Force Command. "your Majesty, in fact, the problem is very simple. You have too little power." Italo Balbo, one of the former leaders of the fascist militia and now the commander of the air force, received her warmly. "it's right not to go to Deng Nanzhai. His delusions about the so-called social republic will destroy everything, but can you guarantee that we can make the country better after we succeed?""
 more_italy.17.a: ""Rome will be great again! In the hands of those who really love her."" 

 more_italy.18.t: "Social republic?"
 more_italy.18.desc: ""Together with the Senate, the emperor's mission should come to an end. " Naturally, D'Annunzio did not mean that the madmen of the Spartacus regiment wanted to send the emperor to the guillotine, but hoped to put an end to the organizational form of the "Roman Empire" and establish a "social republic" that could better represent the people in line with the changes of the times. Unlike the crazy Spartacus who intended to carry out unlimited class cleansing, the Carnaro Charter adopted the class reconciliation model advocated by state unionism, and everything in the country, regardless of class, was United under one leader. "but I don't want to give up the title of emperor." After reading the charter, Nero first said this."
 more_italy.18.a: ""Uh. You want to be emperor in the Republic?"" 
 
 more_italy.19.t: "Political Upheaval"
 more_italy.19.desc: "A series of events finally destabilized the political situation. first of all, Emperor Nero and the poet Gabriele d'Annunzio made a speech in Rome to announce that they would rebuild the "National Fascist Party", which was once all-powerful in the past. The two big signs of "the Emperor personally supported" and "D'Annunzio came out again" soon blew a whirlwind across the Apennines Peninsula. But the mass movement soon made it difficult for the government to carry out its work, and even the supply lines scheduled to be sent to the front lines of the war in Libya were paralyzed, although the Libyan governor, General Rodolfo Graziani, persisted and defeated the Libyans. but the heavy casualties have sparked an anti-war craze at home, and some equally radical movements are on the rise."
 more_italy.19.a: ""There seems to be some unexpected development?""  
 
 more_italy.20.t: "The rise of Fascism"
 more_italy.20.desc: "The speech made by Emperor Nero and Air Force Commander Balbo in Rome quickly blew up the fascist whirlwind sweeping Apennin. after many years, the emperor once again supported the nationalist movement and personally restored the Fascist Party. At the same time of the anger, General Balbo, the second-in-command of the Neo-Fascist Party, also brought good news, as the plight of his air force's massive reinforcement of the Libyan front has been reversed. He even killed the Libyan leader in an operation to fly the plane himself. "It's all thanks to his Majesty's decision!" That's what Balbo said at the triumph."
