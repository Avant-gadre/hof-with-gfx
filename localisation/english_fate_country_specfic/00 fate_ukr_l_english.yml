 ukr_western.1.d:0 ""The revolutionary boldness of the Russians and the pragmatic spirit of the Americans combined are the essence of Leninism in the work of the Party and the work of the State." So said Joseph Dzhugashvili in 1928. It is not necessary to say what the "revolutionary courage of the Russians" was, but the "Americans" were the American environmentalist, engineer, and now senator from New York, Muir Seth. The "work of the Party" here refers to the Dnieper River hydroelectric power plant. Anna Morozova's article claims that the Dnieper hydroelectric power plant was the first major step toward communism, but she and those at the top of the power hierarchy knew that they needed not only Soviet leadership but also capitalist efficiency to achieve their goals. The U.S. Army's Command in Chita had a staff of five or six men, and the White Russian government in Chita remained the only officially recognized legitimate regime in Russia, but this did not at all prevent a group of American advisors from being invited to live in brick houses in the "American Garden City" with two tennis courts and a golf course, to provide American expertise to the managers and engineers of the Dnepr River hydroelectric power plant, and to receive large orders from Moscow for turbines and generators from Newport News Shipbuilding and General Electric. At the head of these American consultants was Muelsyse. \n\nMuelsyse is the chief designer of the entire Dnepr River hydroelectric power plant and basin renovation project. As a young environmentalist and civil engineer, Muelsyse shot to prominence by designing the Toronto hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls and was previously involved in the treatment of the St. Lawrence River. Before she could negotiate a scope of services for the Dnieper River hydroelectric project, Moscow deposited $50,000 into Muelsyse's account. She immediately accepted the offer. The original planned investment for the Dnieper hydroelectric power plant was $50 million, however, by the time it was completed the investment had increased eightfold. Anna Morozova, a central figure in the Supreme Soviet, was on hand to preside over the completion ceremony. Speeches were made, praising communism, and Muelsyse and five other American advisers were presented with the Order of the Red Banner of Labor for their contributions to the cause of communist construction."

Although France was involved in the Soviet civil war with a small force to fight the Bolsheviks, the Parisian side was currently not interested in maintaining the lingering White Bandit regime in Chita due to its own political instability. After some politicians in Paris and Moscow had been exchanging glances for some time, Leo Harvey, the leader of the Democratic-Republican Union, finally decided to visit the Soviet Union in order to increase mutual understanding between the two countries. Leo Harvey was a standard big bourgeois in the Marxist-Leninist sense, but this did not prevent him from being greeted by an honor guard at the Kiev airport and staying in one of Kiev's luxurious hotels, picking up Ukrainian specialties from the foreign store. But this was not so easy and pleasant for the NKVD. The loyal NKVD officers had to fill the empty street stores with decorative food, hide the starving people a block away, and train the school children how to answer the French capitalist's questions. Also, guard against the dastardly assassinations of Ukrainian nationalists and anarchists. \n\nLeo Harvey was very pleased with his visit, and at the school called "Familiy of Felix Dzerzhinsky" he learned that the pupils could eat grilled fish or beef every week. He was soon introduced to the advanced achievements of Soviet industrialization. It seems that he had a lot of preconceptions about the Soviet Union, but that could not be helped, after all, he was a capitalist. \n\nHarvey was also a gourmet, but he always ate in moderation and with a balance of meat and vegetables so that he did not get fat. His next stop was Moscow, where he would taste the most authentic caviar bread and beet soup. Upon his return to Paris, Leo Harvey called the Ukrainian collective farms orderly gardens, and Pravda happily reported Leo Harvey's assessment. The story ends happily."

 ukr_western.3.d:0 "In a recent press conference in London, Soviet exiled military officer Yakir angrily complained about the brutal political purges on the part of Moscow and the tragic results of the failed policy in the Ukrainian region. This accusation appears to have greatly discredited Moscow and their followers around the world, but it also smacks the Western world in the face just as hard. Still, Yakir's accusation is one-sided, lacking more evidence, and more civilians and politicians don't really care what is going on in Ukraine, with some still believing that the Soviet Union has been officially slandered. \n\n "Yakir's accusations are a complete fabrication," is precisely the position of Walter Duranty, a Moscow-based columnist for the New York Times and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. In his New York Times column, Duranty repeatedly claimed that Yakir's statement at the London conference was "a horror story of grandstanding" and that "there was no famine at all," but only "widespread deaths due to malnutrition-induced disease. There is no famine", but "widespread deaths due to malnutrition-induced diseases". This is quite close to the official position of Moscow. Duranty also pointed out that the so-called purges and famines are subordinate to a higher purpose: "You can't fry an egg without breaking it." . \n\nWhile our news media and politicians were arguing about it or watching, the Germans had already taken the lead in public opinion. The portly Hermann Göring claimed that the famine, as Yakir called it, was "all due to Marxism," while Siegfried's royal man of letters, Alfred Rosenberg, claimed that it was part of Moscow's "oppression of the Ukrainian people." The German propaganda machine has already begun to seize this opportunity to run at a fast pace, while our intelligence agencies are not yet able to confirm what is really happening in Ukraine."

The command of the Ukrainian military district, which belonged to him after the end of Dzhugashvili, has finally returned, and the new First Secretary Brezhnev is not interested in, and even less capable of, interfering in military affairs, and urgently needs the army's help in pacifying the population and suppressing infiltrators. This is what Yakir wanted, some infantry units do not have to participate in the recently restarted mechanized exercises, so they will go to various places to assist in defense at the request of the first secretary. However, the army's massive intervention seems to have backfired, even if the soldiers specializing in warfare are not as professional as the police in terms of arresting people, they can't always let people go, right? \n\nNow Marshal Tukhachevsky's message came at the right time, the new Minister of Internal Affairs Beria investigation that there is a certain amount of nationalist infiltrators in the Ukrainian military zone and therefore requested a comprehensive review, Yakir, of course, did not hesitate to agree, in this regard still rely on the Ministry of Internal Affairs to work, anyway, now this group of blue hats can not turn up the waves. What's more, during the Jugashvili period he had been trying to do with his tail between his legs to avoid being arrested one day, and indeed did not understand anything about the loyalty of his subordinates. After \n\n replied to the letter, Yakir suddenly remembered an extremely worrying question. Could it be that the Ministry of Internal Affairs during the reign of Jugashvili did not consider this aspect? The man who was so concerned about loyalty could tolerate the army being infiltrated by a group of exiles? Instead, it is only today that such a major issue is being considered?"

On closer inspection, it became clear how serious the situation was:there were nationalist associates in every division of the Ukrainian military district? And the so-called "Great Uprising" was to find a suitable moment to detonate the Dnepr hydroelectric power station at the inevitable outbreak of the Russian civil war? The rebels will first attack the Ukrainian military district headquarters and then take control of the city of Kiev, where the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile will return across the Bosnian-Soviet border to lead the rebel forces as planned, and a war no less than the one in 1919 will be repeated in this land!""

The main resistance forces in the entire Ukrainian region are now unorganized, and some of the remaining OUN members have tried to take over the temporary office building in Kiev, but the building is also empty and in disarray. At that moment, the head of the anarchist military forces, Néstor Makhno, spoke to Ukraine's temporary radio station and called on the resistance to join him in the fight for a free and equal Ukraine. Some hard-line nationalists refused to obey Makhno, but many officers chose to join Makhno's forces. In this conflict, the anarchists won the final victory, but it remained an open question whether the anarchists could defeat the Bolsheviks."

 ukr_reunion.1.t:0 "Néstor Makhno's revolution"
 ukr_reunion.1.d:0 "Néstor Makhno was undoubtedly the most unique warlord in the Ukrainian regional war of 1917-1922. He led the Black Army that fought successively against the White Army and the Red Army, while he himself and his followers worked to destroy all governments and establish an anarchist democratic society based on peasants and workers. Although their struggle ended in a total Bolshevik victory in Ukraine, the flame of anarchism was still not extinguished. With the severe famine brought about by the Soviet authorities' harsh collectivization and food collection policies in Ukraine since 1932, the Ukrainian peasant revolt against the Bolsheviks was rekindled, and anarchism re-entered the Ukrainian landscape as an alternative to Bolshevism. \n Anarchist activity in the Ukrainian region was mainly guerrilla. The Moscow authorities generally considered anarchist guerrillas to be no different from ordinary peasant rebellions, but the situation changed after Captain Buldrokkas'tee, an officer under Tukhachevsky, led a part of the troops to join the guerrillas. Anarchism was seen as a threat on a par with Ukrainian nationalist organizations, and this continued until the outbreak of the Second Ukrainian War of Independence. For the authorities in Moscow and the Ukrainian Soviet government in Kiev, the most notorious anarchist bandit was Yelena Frostnova, known as the "White Rabbit". \nAfter the outbreak of the Second Ukrainian War of Independence, Makhno also returned from exile in France to lead the anarchist revolution in Ukraine. Since the anarchists did not control the same areas as the nationalists, the two did not clash for the time being. With the fall of Petliura's government and the disappearance of Bandera, Makhno seized the power vacuum and, in one fell swoop, gathered a large number of Ukrainian rebels to join the Black Army. The time had come to belong to anarchism."

During the Battle of Warsaw in 1922, he was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal and promoted to the rank of captain for his service in covering the retreat of the main force. During the Tsarist period, Buldrokkas'tee's troops were known for their good military discipline, and after joining the Red Army he was widely praised. \n\nWith the end of the Soviet New Economic Policy and the widespread implementation of the collectivization policy, the idle units were mobilized again to suppress the peasant rebellion in the Ukraine, to search for OUN infiltrators and to combat anarchist guerrillas. However, in 1933. During a food collection mission for the collective farms on the Ukrainian border, Buldrokkas'tee discovered that his son, whom he had left behind for a year, had died of starvation in his home, and that the troops not under his command had only been collecting food from his son's home, not even bothering to bury it. Shocked and outraged, Buldrokkas'tee led a part of his inner circle to defect to the anarchist partisan forces in the southern Ukraine. Such a serious defection of an officer shocked Moscow. Kaganovich was then removed from his post. And the repressive activities against anarchism were put on the central agenda of the Kiev side. \n\nUnlike the local Ukrainian anarchists who hid their Ukrainian nationalist tendencies, the West Ukrainian-born Buldrokkas'tee was so devoted to his Russian homeland that he was jokingly called a "patriot". He joined the anarchist movement out of sympathy for the brutal conditions of the Ukrainian peasantry and out of anger at the atrocities committed by the Dzhugashvili authorities. During his guerrilla campaign in the south of Ukraine, he adopted Yelena Frostnova, a partisan from the now Romanian-occupied region of Moldova, as his adopted daughter, who became the most feared partisan "white rabbit" by the Kiev authorities. It is worth noting that, unlike many Jews who joined the left-wing movement, Buldrokkas'tee was also a Zionist sympathizer. He believed that Theresia's promise of a peaceful and democratic Jewish-Arab state would be fulfilled in the end."

Since time was running out for a vote in the various local soviets, a simple emergency vote was taken by the soviet deputies still on standby in the Kiev suburbs. The result was that Talula Artorius, a deputy from the Kharkov region, won the vote and was elected as the new Black Army Gaitman. \n\nTalula Artorius was once the adopted daughter of a notorious old Russian nobleman, who ran away in anger because she could not stand the family's control over her and the cruel plundering of the poor peasants. During the Civil War in 1920, Artorius briefly joined the Bolsheviks and the Red Army, becoming a Bolshevik cadre in the local soviet in Kharkov, before being expelled for publicly criticizing Trotsky in the newspapers. Artorius then led some of her loyal cadres to join the Black Army under Makhno, and in the 1921 offensive against the White Army led by Peter Wrangel showed great leadership skills and charisma, and was widely praised by the local peasants. In Finland in 1930, she met Yelena Frostnova, a former comrade who was ready to return to the Ukraine first to start the resistance, and Alina, the editor of a local left-wing newspaper, and the three formed a friendship. \n\nWith the outbreak of the Ukrainian War of Independence again, Artorius and Makhno and others returned to Ukraine in succession to try to re-establish the Black Army. After the fall of Petliura's regime, Artorius gave a very successful speech in Kiev and persuaded some of the officers loyal to Petliura to join the Black Army. This greatly increased her prestige. Today, Talula Artorius has been elected as the new Gestapo of the Black Army and has become the new Batko ("Father") among many Ukrainian peasants. Talula Artorius was a little uncomfortable after being called "Papa," but she was ready to lead the whole anarchist movement to victory."

It was Alina who gave Talula Artorius firm moral support when she was at her most disillusioned. With the Black Army taking the leadership of the Ukrainian War of Independence, Alina decided to leave for Ukraine to support the cause of her closest friend. This was the first time that her ideals would be put into practice.

 ukr_reunion.6.d:0 "Despite Simon Petliura's claim that "the enemy of the Jews is the enemy of Ukraine," he did not have any interest in disciplining the officers under his command. For a long time, Jews were considered natural allies of the Bolsheviks because of the "Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy theory" that prevailed in the Western world. And because of the influence of old religious theology, many conservative officers also saw Jews as the enemy. As a result, repression and even massacres of Jews began to take place everywhere since the outbreak of the Ukrainian War of Independence. Despite the fact that after the fall of Petliura's regime a large number of troops fell to the Black Army and some of them had no intention of joining it, anti-Semitic activities were still prevalent everywhere. Despite the fact that Talula Artorius came to power and put out the fires, anti-Semitic activities continued. During a mission to rescue Jewish refugees, Talula's own troops searched a village based on intelligence and found that the village people had assisted the former Petliura army stationed there in inhumanely torturing Jews seeking food by starving them alive while locked in empty barns. It appears that these people gave the starvation brought about by the failed Bolshevik policy to their imaginary Bolshevik agents, the Jews. \nTalula was extremely angry after witnessing this atrocity, and the dream of creating a society where all peoples lived in harmony was mercilessly humiliated right before his eyes ......"

 ukr_reunion.7.d:0 "Since the imposition of the collectivization policy by Joseph Dzhugashvili, the famine in the Ukrainian region began to expand at a visible rate. Despite the removal of Kaganovich, who was in charge of collecting grain, in 1932 due to the defection of Buldrokkas'tee, the imposed collectivization and food collection system still did not provide substantial relief. Moscow claimed to destroy the "Kulak" by collecting from the Ukrainian peasants, but the officials who came to collect were often richer than the richest "Kulak" in the region. This was represented by Leonid Brezhnev and his "Dnepr gang". Brezhnev, working as a deputy under Khrushchev, was keen to use forceful methods to seize grain and claim credit from Moscow, while at the same time he and his colleagues accumulated a lot of wealth during the collectivization process and stocked up on caviar in his family's warehouses. \n This bastard has now fallen into our hands. Brezhnev now cries and cries on his knees in front of Talula, claiming that it was all Jugashvili's fault and that he was only carrying out orders. buldrokkas'tee suggested that he be imprisoned or reformed through labor, but Talula seems to be even more indignant about Brezhnev's behavior."

Tallulah and Bodrokasti disagreed on whether to leave the Western Ukraine to accept more armed peasants, and Bodrokasti resented Tallulah's practice of releasing a group of local militiamen who did not want to continue the struggle and distributing large amounts of supplies to them. \Tallulah soon paid the price for her decision. While resupplying in the western Dnieper, Tallulah's immediate forces drove out a group of local militiamen who had unsuccessfully tried to fight for food, and then repelled a small group of Ukrainian nationalist organizations. However, Tallulah found that Alina, who was with her as she prepared to cross the Dnieper River, had been plundered and killed by the militia she had just let go in exchange for supplies in the next village. The marauders even cut off Alina's arm to take the basket and took the plain silver ring that Tallulah had given to Alina. \n Before she broke off, Alina broke off and explained to Tallulah that all this was not her fault, that she was on the right track, and not to be blinded by hatred and fear. Alina finally asks Yelena Frostnova to take her place in the supervision of Talula Artorius."

 ukr_reunion.9.d:0 "With Reunion's leadership in the revolutionary war throughout Ukraine established, it was time to convene a congress of Reunion soviets in the Ukrainian regions in accordance with Néstor Makhno's vision and Talula Artorius' plan. Talula Artorius gave an infectious speech and Yelena Frostnova presided over the agenda. However, there were still many discordant voices. A number of local trade union representatives, especially those of industrial workers, were very uncomfortable with our ideas and ideals, and they seemed to prefer the Social Democratic Labor Party of Ukraine. These discordant voices were quickly countered by the representatives of the railroad workers' soviet, but still set off a firestorm of controversy. Many trade union representatives and some peasant leaders, who were also members of the Social Democratic Labor Party and the former Social Revolutionary Party, demanded that we restore the Central Rada, have nationwide representative universal suffrage, and stop the unchaptered redistribution until legislation was passed. \nThese blatant demands for the restoration of bourgeois democracy will naturally not be treated well by us. With an order from Talula Artorius, the remnants of Petliura's followers were blown out of the room by the cadres of the Reunion."

 ukr_reunion.10.t:0 "Search for social democrats"
 ukr_reunion.10.d:0 "Talula Artorius has always been respected by all sides for her tolerance of sectarianism and amazing leadership. But since the Soviet Congress, Talula Artorius has become agitated and suspicious, most likely as a consequence of the multiple mental stresses represented by Alina's death since the outbreak of the war. She could no longer tolerate any further challenges to her authority, especially when a group of social democrats openly opposed her revolutionary plans at the Soviet Congress. She demanded that Reunion carry out a complete "revolutionary repression" of these "counter-revolutionaries, bourgeois politicians and Bolshevik saboteurs". It is clear that the Social Democratic Labor Party and Reunion itself have been entangled since the fall of the Petliura regime and the mass defection of its personnel. The liquidation of the Social Democratic Labor Party would undoubtedly require another "revolution" against many urban unions and a considerable number of agricultural cooperatives, and a considerable number of union leaders and village council representatives would have to be implicated."

 ukr_reunion.11.t:0 "The Evolution of the Revolution"
 ukr_reunion.11.d:0 "Ever since the Black Army was founded and confronted the White and Red armies, criticism has been directed at the Black Army. It has been argued that the anarchist organization was ultimately no different from the average warlord, except that the Military Revolutionary Committee was controlling power in a more secretive way. To some extent, these criticisms have been valid, especially since the Black Army grew and Reunion was founded. But these criticisms were soon weakened by Reunion's purge of internal social democrats, as Reunion itself moved toward a state of informal violence and terror as an alternative to state violence. Obviously, at least in terms of results, this was very different from what Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Makhno had envisioned, but it seemed so natural that the slow-witted could not detect it for a moment. In any case, Reunion has now become Talula Artorius' machine for revolutionary terror, fueled by hatred of the rebels. For Talula, she could not tolerate any more obstacles on the road to her utopia, all enemies, factionalists, Bolsheviks, Moscow and Warsaw, they all had to be destroyed."
 ukr_reunion.11.a:0 "Long live Talula!"
 
 ukr_reunion.12.t:0 "Conflict"
 ukr_reunion.12.d:0 ""Let me repeat, my claim is clear. Our operational bottleneck is undoubtedly the Dnieper River. As soon as we cross the Dnieper, the Soviet line will not be so strong. the Reunion flag must cross the Dnieper, it must fly over Kharkiv, and we must even drive the Bolsheviks out of Donbass. "Talula Artorius was no longer prepared to give Bodrokasti any room for rebuttal, but the young woman was still wary of facing the battle-hardened veteran, a brilliant orator and an inspiring leader, but she had not served under Makhno for so long. Bozokasti, on the other hand, was a commander who had fought outside Warsaw, in Lviv, and in the Crimea. \n \n "Miss Artorius, I understand your ambition to bring more people into the free zone and your urgent need to expand your ranks. But I, as a professional military man, have claims that I must uphold. I do not believe that our forces are sufficient to enable us to advance into the Donbass, especially since you continue to give away supplies that could have fed our soldiers to the units that broke away from the Black Army." The old codger always wore a black helmet that made it impossible to see what expression he was wearing, but everyone in the command had caught a whiff of sharp conflict. \n\nTalula became a little agitated. Frostnova sat on a makeshift bench in command staring at the map without saying a word, but her eyes were clearly not on the Dnieper, nor on the Donbass. Néstor Makhno had not said anything about turning the entire Ukraine into a free area, but it was clear that the Black Army was predominantly ethnic Ukrainian and predominantly Ukrainian-speaking, and liberating the entire Ukraine was the natural choice. But would the Russian-speaking regions of eastern Ukraine welcome her, Talula herself had no idea, but she felt she always had to try." With all due respect, I have to wonder if you are questioning my leadership skills or are losing faith in our cause. You know how Moscow has treated the people of the Ukrainian region for the last five years, and they will do the same thing if we give up Kharkov and Donbass. You know this better than I do, Mr. Bozokasti, after having dealt with the Russians for so long. Or should I call you by your elegant name, 'Patriot'?" \n\nThe word "Russian" had already raised the tension in the room, and Talula's naming of "patriot" added fuel to the fire. Yes, the Black Army is a team with internationalist ideals, and Reunion is an internationalist movement. Many officers and soldiers of Reunion hide their Ukrainian nationalism, and some of those who are attached to the Russian motherland are not aware of it, Talula and Bozokasti are just a few of them. Maybe Reunion can really keep its own undertones, or maybe Talula and Petliura are not so different in the first place. Fortunately, these conflicts were just an episode in the war with the Bolsheviks, albeit a somewhat worrisome one ......"

It's one thing to speak up for the Jews, it's another thing to move them to Palestine to build a state. And that Austrian legacy, Kelsch, her obscure writing seems ridiculous to me. In some ways she's not even as good as Alfred Rosenberg ......" \n \n Bodrokasti was still wearing his black helmet, but couldn't hide the fact that he was a bit agitated, "Yelena, Speaker Theresia has promised to create a democratic state where all peoples are equal. I know she's not like us, and our definition of socialism may be different, but she's more capable and insightful than you think. Now Bund has also changed her position and supports her Babel Program ......" \n\\n "In the end it's still colonization ......" \n\n "Everywhere the Jews go now is colonization!" Buldrokkas'tee interrupted Frostnova, his voice becoming loud, but shaky." Yelena, you don't understand, you don't understand what it's like for an oppressed people to be without a homeland for centuries! Israel is not my homeland, my homeland is the great Russia. But I can feel my fellow countrymen their situation, their pain. I believe in the future of Israel, just as I believe in the future of Russia." \n\nThe night was only silent except for the crackling of the fire. Inez and W sat side by side behind a large rock quietly eavesdropping on their conversation, W lighting a cigarette as they both fell silent. They had both been members of the Bund before they joined Reunion, and the same arguments and divisions had occurred within the Bund. Everything seemed to be a dilemma, even the moonlight seemed to mock the fate of the Eastern European Jews."

But an interesting rumor is starting to make things interesting. According to Chita's claims, Anastasia Romanova, the rightful heir with the Romanov family, has been crowned as the new Tsar in Chita. However, this rumor claims that the tsarina in Chita is a fake. The real tsarina is no other than Yelena Frostnova, the core cadre of Reunion. After all, according to the official portrait, Anastasia is a white-haired woman with bangs covering one eye, and is often associated with winter, ice and snow. All of the above features match Frostnova very closely, except for the rabbit-ear headdress that Frostnova wore to mock the Bolshevik snipers. The irony of this rumor, however, is that Anastasia is a representative of the authoritarianism of the old empire, while Frostnova is an anarchist revolutionary. \The message eventually reached Frostnova's ears, and the Reunion cadres didn't take it seriously - after all, there were rumors that Talula was a puppet of the old Russian aristocracy, and when Frostnova heard the rumor, she prodded a mouthful of spittle into the fireplace."Me? The cowardly bastard hiding in his little palace in Chita? The punk who rides around on peasants grooming and pretending to be pathetic?""

 ukr.10.t:0 "Composition of the Ukrainian Independence Army"
 ukr.10.d:0 "Just like the hastily formed ranks that rebelled against Tsarist Russia and the Bolshevik revolutionaries twenty years earlier, the Ukrainian rebels, who had seized upon the failed policy of Dzhugashvili, were still a rabble of soldiers from all walks of life. The Ukrainian Social-Democratic Labor Party and the Ukrainian Social-Revolutionary Party were consolidated under the leadership of Simon Petliura, and after the defeat of the First War of Independence the remnants went into exile in France. Some members of the Ukrainian Social Revolutionary Party joined the Bolsheviks, but most of them were imprisoned during the first purges against the Ukrainian regional communist parties in 1932-1934. As Britain, France, and the United States ignored the demands of Ukrainian exiles for independence and the complaints of famine in Ukraine, some generals loyal to Simon Petliura began contacts with the newly emerging Germany after their exile. The most enthusiastic German advocate of Ukrainian independence was undoubtedly Alfred Rosenberg, a leading theoretician of the German People's Party, who first contacted Simon Petliura in Paris in 1934.\nThe radical right wing, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), led by Yevhen Konovalets, chose instead to launch a campaign of resistance and sabotage against the Polish occupiers in the Polish-occupied regions of Galicia and Volynia. As the Polish government became increasingly authoritarian, repression against ethnic Ukrainians intensified, just as the OUN had hoped, and in 1934, the OUN's newest leader, Stepan Bandera, shocked all of Europe by organizing the successful assassination of Polish Interior Minister Bronisław Piełacki. Beginning in 1935, the Polish government began to systematically drive OUN-trained militias into Soviet territory and to take in Ukrainian peasants who had fled to Poland because of hunger. Through this series of actions, the Polish government successfully used the failure of Soviet policy in Ukraine to induce Ukrainian nationalists to turn against the Soviet Union.\nDespite widespread repression, the conservative old Cossack groups still had some influence among Ukrainian peasants. The former Habsburg Vasyl Vyshvany led this conservative force. His ally, the former Gaitman Pavel Skoropatsky, had collaborated with the invaders of the German Empire to expel the Russian Empire and Bolshevik influence. Nevertheless, the conservatives led by Skoropatsky maintained their ties with the Imperial Russian government in Chita. Unlike Skoropatsky, Vyshvany had his own intentions regarding Ukraine.\nThere was also a most unusual resistance force, the anarchist Black Army led by Néstor Makhno. The anarchists had allied themselves with the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War, but then clashed with them to the point where they were finally annihilated. Makhno himself went into exile in France, where he joined other socialists in their struggle against the restored Bourbon government. Dzhugashvili's brutal policy and failed repression in Ukraine led to a resurgence of anarchism among the peasantry, and a former Red Army officer under General Tukhachevsky, Buldrokas'tee, joined the anarchist partisans directly. This time, anarchists and nationalists seemed to be temporary allies in the fight against the Bolsheviks, but there was no doubt that they would eventually come to confront each other. Only one conception of Ukraine would triumph."

 ukr.11.d:0 "Yevhen Konovalets, the founder of the Ukrainian Nationalist Organization (OUN), was a thorn in the side of the Polish government in Warsaw, the Soviet government in Moscow, and the Russian imperial government in Chita. Yevhen Konovalets had seized an army of Ukrainians from the old Austrian Empire in 1918 to support Simon Petliura, and went into exile after the failure of Ukrainian independence. In its program, the OUN proclaimed that it would \"enslave other nations for the freedom of Ukraine\"; in its actions, it often resorted to terrorism in its confrontation with Poland and the Soviet Union. In its actions, the OUN often resorted to terrorist methods in its confrontation with Poland and the Soviet Union, such as assassination of dignitaries, destruction of facilities, and assassination of Ukrainians who tried to cooperate with the authorities, in order to provoke conflicts between them. These acts were undoubtedly hated by Warsaw, Moscow and Chita.\n\nAs Simon Petliura returned to Ukraine to take part in the uprising against Moscow, Konovalets also came to Ukraine to join the fight by organizing the OUN militia. Konovalets' alliance with Petliura was temporary, but solid, at least for this short period of time. This was also clear on the part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet intelligence agency NKVD had previously developed numerous assassination plans against Konovalets. Today, Konovalets arrived at the Kyiv station, where an NKVD agent disguised as a delivery man presented him with a box of cakes sent to him by his friend, which was a carefully disguised bomb."

Yet the fundamental philosophical conflict between the two is simply too great, and continued cooperation will only make their respective ideals unattainable in compromise.\n\nHowever, more than a decade ago, it was the former Austro-Hungarian Army \"Sechi Riflemen\" led by Konovalets that provided Petliura with the crucial force that enabled the latter to ascend to the position of head of the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic. So why not continue the cooperation? It's all for Ukraine."
