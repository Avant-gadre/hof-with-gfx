 TUR_fully_integrate_the_is_bank_desc:0 "Celâl Bayar and a group of likeminded liberals and advocates for democracy have bound themselves to the institution of the İş Bank, which Atatürk established in 1924.

 TUR_privatize_the_anadolu_agency_desc:0 "Freedom of the press is a necessity under a true democracy, and though we may not love a free media we will just have to learn to cope with them.

 TUR_permit_regional_elections_desc:0 "Turkey is a large country of many religions, cultures, and interests - perhaps it would not be flexing the boundaries of the constitution too badly if we were to allow a certain degree of autonomy across the nation, even to those that have rallied hardest against Kemalism... all in the name of national security, of course."

 TUR_the_hatay_issue:0 "The Hatay Issue"
 TUR_the_hatay_issue_desc:0 "We can no longer sit idly by and allow the oppression of Turkish minorities by Arab irredentists and French imperialists.

 TUR_continue_the_policy_of_etatism_desc:0 "İsmet İnönü and a group of fellow left-wing ministers are in favor of pivoting our economic policy away from laissez-faire liberalism and towards a uniquely Turkish state-managed economy.

 TUR_turk_ulusu:0 "Türk Ulusu"
 TUR_turk_ulusu_desc:0 "Part of being a responsible and modern country is being able to redefine what it means to be a citizen of said country.

 TUR_loosen_the_laws_on_secularism:0 "Loosen the Laws on Secularism"
 TUR_loosen_the_laws_on_secularism_desc:0 "Religion has been the single greatest dividing factor for our nation: we have committed to a path of secularism, but why? To mimic the weak nations of the west? It is not the business of the state to decide when, where, and how a man prays to his god."

 TUR_purify_the_diyanet_desc:0 "The Diyanet has been stacked with men who have never prayed to the Almighty even once in their empty, hollow lives. The Diyanet should be filled with men of faith: men who service themselves to the state and turn to Allah for guidance and comfort!"

 TUR_kemalist_socialist_theory_desc:0 "The Kadro Movement stands for a fundamentally patriotic form of socialism, and is very akin to the British strain of fascism and Marxism-Leninism in many ways. In essence, Kadro puts the Turkish worker first on a fundamental level, and does not seek to sweep away their national identity while doing so.
