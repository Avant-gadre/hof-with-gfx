 AUS_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 AUS_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 AUS_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 AUS_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 AUS_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 AUS_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 AUS_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 AUS_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 AUS_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 AUS_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 AUS_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 AUS_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 AUS_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 AUS_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
 AUS_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
 AUS_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
 AUS_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a licence to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."

 AUS_light_tank_equipment_1_short: "leKpfW M.35"
 AUS_light_tank_equipment_1_desc: "In 1933, the k.u.k. Army realised that its incoherent tank fleet consisting of older foreign tank designs and domestic tankettes is rapidly losing combat effectiveness against new syndicalist and German designs. As a stop-gap measure, it decided to adopt the new Škoda Š-II export tank. The modern design was equipped with a two-man turret with 37mm gun and pneumatic gearbox and running gears, which was the tanks biggest problem due to its complexity and low reliability."
 AUS_light_tank_equipment_2: "ČKD Leichter Kampfwagen Modell 38"
 AUS_light_tank_equipment_2_short: "leKpfW M.38"
 AUS_light_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Even as the first leKpfW M.35 were coming off the production line, the army was already looking for new cavalry tank. In the following design competition multiple domestic and foreign designs were considered, but in the end, the army chose one of the TNH models from ČKD. Just as with the M.35, TNHP had a two-man turret and an improved 37mm gun, but the M.38 improved on the M.35's armour, engine and possessed much simpler and reliable running gears. Unfortunately due to Black-Monday, the first units wouldn't enter service until 1938."
 AUS_light_tank_equipment_3: "ČKD Leichter Kampfwagen Modell 42"
 AUS_light_tank_equipment_3_short: "leKpfW M.42"
 AUS_light_tank_equipment_3_desc: "While the heavier M.40 replaced M.38 in the main combat role, there was still a need for a smaller and lighter tracked reconnaissance vehicle. To keep track with the quick pace of war development, ČKD completely redesigned the upper part of the TNHP design. The new reconnaissance tank had improved tracks, sloped frontal armour and new turret housing the commander, gunner and the brand new autoloading 57mm gun developed by Škoda."

 AUS_medium_tank_equipment_2_short: "mKpfW M.42"
 AUS_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc: "While at the start of the war the armament and armour of M.40 were more than sufficient, the introduction of infantry held AT weapons using shaped charges and the increasing armour thickness of enemy tanks marked the M.40 as nearly obsolete by the end of 1941. In response, Škoda's engineers drew up a new design with a similar base but possessing an entirely new engine, armoured side skirts and stronger frontal armour. MAVÁG would provide a completely new turret while also improving crew space and the field of vision within the vehicle altogether with long barrel 75 mm gun."

With the various Czech and Hungarian companies being busy with cavalry tanks, Ferdinand von Porsche's design was the only one submitted in time and would be produced by Austro-Daimler. Equipped with 100mm frontal armour and an 80mm gun from Bofors this tank was feared by any who had to fight against it.

 AUS_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc: "The TVP hull was first designed by ČKD as a competitor to Weiss Manfréd's M.44 tank during the design competition for the contract to replace the ageing fleet of M.40/42s, where it would be rejected due to its larger dimensions. However, as the war progressed, army high command would issue a directive mandating the adoption of Škoda's new autoloading 105mm gun by lighter tanks in response to the heavily armoured series Russian T-120 and French M4 tanks and, as a result of its previously unfortunate size, only the TVP hull was sufficiently large enough for the role."

 AUS_amphibious_tank_equipment_1_desc: "In the 1930s, the Military Technical Committee became interested in an amphibious tank capable of operating across the Monarchy's many rivers and around the Adriatic. ČKD would provide a variant of its AH-IV tankette, the F-IV-H, for the role. It only had a machine gun for armament, but the design would only be surpassed in 1940 by Miklos Straussler's revolutionary \"Doppelantriebe\" (duplex-drive) system."

 AUS_amphibious_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Analysis of airborne operations during the war clearly demonstrated the need for armoured support for paratroopers. Early attempts addressed the size and weight constraints necessary to fit cargo planes, only to be delayed by new demands for amphibious capabilities. The resulting design was a sleek, low-profile light tank with a capable 57mm autocannon."

 AUS_infantry_equipment_0: "Karabiner Modell 1895/30"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mannlicher M.95/30"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Modell 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 #FÉG 35M
 AUS_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabiner Modell 1935"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG M.35"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

 AUS_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Danuvia M.39"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."

 AUS_infantry_equipment_3: "Maschinenkarabiner Modell 1942"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zbrojovka Brno M.42"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."
 #MP 34:
 AUS_infantry_weapons2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 1934"
 AUS_infantry_weapons2_short: "Steyr-Solothurn M.34"
 AUS_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While a German design by Louis Stange, the  MP 34 was mainly produced by Steyr and was adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army. As common with early submachine guns, this design was heavy, expensive, but reliable, with a horizontal magazine using the potent 9x25mm Mauser cartridge."

 AUS_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "Zbrojovka Brno M.38"
 AUS_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Seeing the need for a submachine-gun using the standard pistol cartridge of the Army, the Monarchy would adopt the ZK 383, designed by brothers Josef and František Koucký at Zbrojovka Brno, as the MP 38. Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

 AUS_advanced_infantry_weapons2_short: "Danuvia M.43"
 AUS_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While the Danuvia 39M proved successful, its folding magazine was not enough to compensate for its bulky design for vehicle crewmen. The 43M redesign with a folding metal stock and a new, more reliable foldable magazine design allowed it to be much more compact during transport or storage, without sacrificing firepower."

 AUS_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "To observers and theorists, the civil war in America showcased modern mechanised warfare and showed how much tracked vehicles had improved in reliability and cross-country capabilities. As a stop-gap measure to improve the mobility of its motorised infantry, the Armee-Oberkommando assigned numerous artillery tractors, mostly of the Praga T-series, to its rapid divisions, redesignating them as tracked troop transports until proper armoured carriers could be introduced."

 AUS_mechanized_equipment_2_desc: "The Saurer RR-7 was a hybrid armoured vehicle that could use both tracks or wheels. It was introduced as an artillery tractor in 1937, but proved to be a far more versatile vehicle with its light armour and high mobility. Not only would it fill the role of a reconnaissance vehicle, but also that of a troop transport, making it the Monarchy's first armoured vehicle of that type."
