 CZE_fortification_studies:0 "Fortification Studies"
 CZE_fortification_studies_desc:0 "The need to fortify our border is clear, but the question is how? The French have recently constructed an incredible fortified line of their own, the Maginot Line, and by sending a delegation to study their methods it should be possible to solve our own border defense problems."
 CZE_fallback_line:0 "Fallback Line"
 CZE_fallback_line_desc:0 "If the border cannot be held, it would be well to have a second line of fortification to fall back on before any attack from the west can reach our heartland."

 CZE_favor_czechs_1:0 "Czech Industry"
 CZE_favor_czechs_1_desc:0 "There has always been tension between the Czechs and Slovaks within our nation, not least because much of our industrial power is concentrated in the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia.

 CZE_arms_exports_2:1 "Export Subsidies"
 CZE_arms_exports_2_desc:1 "As the threat of war looms, more and more nations are looking to purchase tanks. Government guarantees for loans and other measures can encourage other countries to buy Czechoslovakian, and improve the economies of scale even further."
