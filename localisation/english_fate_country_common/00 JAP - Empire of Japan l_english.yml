 jap_elective.3.d: "The young political leader Kirisame Marisa who became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1932 has always been one of the most controversial figures in Japanese politics. Marisa Kirime, who was born in a retailer family, looks very special in Japan where family politics is overwhelming, but she is even more special because of her diplomatic talent and superb negotiation skills. Although she has obtained a lot of economic benefits for Japan in many foreign affairs, and has also worked hard to win some trust in Western countries, the "non-interference policy" she advocates on the issue of China's civil war is regarded as weak. And now, she is now an important figure to be assassinated by the Blood League. \nYesterday, Lieutenant Mikami Taku led the two rushed into Marisa's personal apartment in Tokyo, but their actions were discovered by Misty who had just returned home. The two sides engaged in a fierce gun battle in the corridor of the apartment. After Mikami Taku was shot to death by Kirisame Marisa, the remaining two fled the scene, but Marisa was only shot in her left arm."

 jap_elective.4.d: "Tohsaka Group is one of the three giants in Japan's banking industry, and Tohsaka Tokiomi, the chairman of the Tosaka Group, is also an important figure in Japanese politics. Tohsaka Group not only owns a large number of banking industries, but also holds a large number of shares in the construction, automobile, and shipbuilding industries. For the blood alliance group, such a powerful person must naturally be destroyed. Yesterday, a masked person in a black cloak bypassed the security and rushed into Tosaka's mansion to try to murder Tosaka, who happened to be at home."

Chairperson Yakumo Yukari asked Rikken Seiyukai to form a new cabinet immediately. Influenced by the family's political traditions, Tohsaka Rin, the daughter of Tohsaka Tokiomi, won by a narrow margin and was able to form a new cabinet. Despite being the successor of the Tohsaka Group, Tohsaka Rin is a very rebellious and ruthless character. In fact, the Military has already started a secret meeting to deal with this difficult guy."

 jap_elective.6.d: "Although the Tokko has determined that the people responsible for the first two assassinations are Inoue Nisshou and Mikami Taku, the Tokko has no idea about the third assassin who sneaked in alone. In fact, rumors about the man in black have spread all over Japan: some people say it is male, others say it is female; some say it always carries three daggers, and some say its unique skill is a pistol. .. However, Tokko found a diary in the hiding den of a member of the Ketsumeidan. On the title page, the word "Nue" was written, and it contained the following paragraph: \nI and Tohsaka Tokiomi are adversarial, one is The one who kills is the one who was killed. However, if you look at its essence truthfully, the so-called Tokiomi is the Tokiomi in my heart. What is my heart? That is the heart of the great Tathagata... In the process of killing Tokiomi, I dimly felt that I had mastered some things in Buddhism...\nEverything is a past life, I didn't kill him for the sake of killing. Tosaka did not die to die. Killing is for the sake of the country, and being killed is also for the country... My own assassination is a mysterious assassination. I only recognize myself and Tosaka when the goal is achieved."

 jap_elective.7.d: "Compared with Tohsaka's wealth and status, the Aozaki family seems to be less prominent, but the Aozaki family has recently fallen into a dilemma of inheritance rights. Five years ago, Aozaki Touko's grandfather suddenly transferred the inheritance rights to her sister, Aozaki Aoko, causing Aozaki Touko to run away angrily and severed relations with them. Now Aozaki Touko has become a well-known figure in Japanese political and business circles, and the issue of inheritance rights has re-fermented to the Court of Justice because of some trivial matters. Then the judgment of the Supreme Court is..."

Under various pressures, Aozaki Touko had to take the blame and resign. Rikken Minseitou therefore elected Aozaki Aoko, a marginal member who had just won the lawsuit, as the prime minister to maintain Rikken Minseitou's image among the people and the majority of seats in the National Assembly."

 jap_elective.27.d: "Okazaki Yumemi is the most important constitutionalist of the Japanese Empire, one of the most authoritative scholars in the field of constitutional jurisprudence since the Meiji era, and also a member of the aristocracy. His important theory is "Okazaki Yumemi". The main content of this theory is that "the sovereignty of a country belongs to the state as a legal person, and the Empress is its supreme organ, and exercises its ruling power under the prime ministers of many organs headed by the cabinet". The opposite theory of "the sovereignty of the Empress" holds that "the Empress is the state, and the rule belongs to the Empress." \nThe dispute between the two constitutional doctrines was originally confined to academia, but Inubashiri Momizi, a former Lieutenant General, in Kizuko In, thought the doctrine was "anti-nationalistic" and called for the removal of Okazaki Yumemi from the higher Education examination Institute in Kizuko In. At the same time, Professor Kuzuki Souichirou of the Professional School of the Imperial College criticized the "Criminal Law handout" and "Criminal Law Reader" published by Onozuka Komachi, believing that Onozuka "advocated Marxism" in the book and reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs that the publication of the two books should be banned."
 jap_elective.27.a: "What does that mean?"
 jap_elective.28.t: "Politicization of the Empress-Institution theory debate"
 jap_elective.28.d: "The ignited the Empress-Institution theory debate was quickly politicized. Recently, the "Federation for supporting the National Sports", composed of right-wing politicians and scholars, distributed to the army and navy, the rural soldiers, the educational circles, and the Shinto circles, a pamphlet entitled "on Dr. Okazaki Yumemi's thoughts on disturbing the State system," written by Dr. Motoori Kosuzu, a member of the Kizuko In, to incite public opinion to attack Okazaki Yumemi. \nAt the House Budget Committee, Sonoda Umi, a former major general of the Army and a member of the House of Representatives, thought that Okazaki Yumemi had "violated the power of the Empress" and disordered the constitution of the country, and asked Komeiji Satori, the then interior minister, to express his views. However, Okazaki Yumemi stuck to his point of view, still defended his theory at the Kizuko In conference, and loudly denounced Inubashiri Momizi as an "ignorant", Inubashiri Momizi accused Okazaki Yumemi as a "academic bandit"."

The Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy made a report at the cabinet meeting together. Director of Education than Hinanawi Tenshi even issued an internal instruction that the Army must severely reject the Empress-Institution theory. At the same time, the Greater Japan Productivity Party also submitted a "suicide proposal" to the Okazaki Yumemi, and other right-wing political parties, such as the National Socialist Party and the Oriental Council, also issued statements one after another, demanding that the publication of Okazaki Yumemi works be banned and that he resign from public office."

 jap_elective.34.d: "The Empress's agency said that the debate on the issue has passed for a long time, but the government has not given clear instructions on this issue. As part of the reform, we must clarify our national system, get rid of all heresies, and show our political blueprint to the whole of Japan.  \nThe statement about Kokutai Meicho is as follows: respectfully, the state system of our country is clearly stated by the Imperial God at the time of the coming of Heaven and Sun. The Empress for all ages rules the country. Because of the promulgation of the Constitution, it is declared that "the great power of the rule of the state is inherited from the ancestors and passed on to the descendants." the first article of the Constitution clearly states that "the Japanese Empire is ruled by a series of Empresss for all ages." That is, the sovereignty of the Japanese empire seems to exist in the Empress."

 jap_elective.35.t: "Hinanawi Tenshi and Dai Nippon Seisantou"
 jap_elective.35.d: "Hinanawi Tenshi is undoubtedly the most eye-catching one among contemporary Japanese aristocrats, thanks to her rebellious character and behavior. Earlier than the Empress, he was dissatisfied with Japan's corrupt democratic politics and bureaucracy, and had more critical remarks about the chaebol and aristocratic system. In 1932, when Bina met the national socialist activist Kita Ikki, he was immediately attracted by his profound thoughts, and Kita Ikki praised her as "Kizuko In's only conscience." Although Kita Ikki was assassinated by anarchists in 1935, Hinanawi Tenshi had a persistent enthusiasm for Showa Reform.\n At the same time, Hinanawi has a close relationship with Xuanyang Society and  black Dragon Society. When Dai Nippon Seisantou, the Great Japan Productivity Party was founded in 1934, Hinanawi Tenshi was the only member of the Japanese Diet who sent a letter of congratulations. The Greater Japan production Party was founded to realize the unity of the Japanese right on the basis of Greater Japanism and to promote the cause of reform. In its heyday, it had 16000 members, but later stabilized at about 3000. Its program includes, \n1. Subvert the subjugation parliamentary politics and realize the rule of the Empress;\n2. Establish industrial power and overthrow capitalism;\n3. Overcome the domestic class antagonism, in order to promote the national prestige in the world. However, the production Party, as the right-wing United front, is caught in the opposition of the Black Dragon Society system, the National Socialist Party and the Old National Party, and unlike what Hinanawi Tenshi expects of them, the production Party is still an unstable alliance."
 jap_elective.35.a: "But what can they do?"
 jap_elective.36.t: "Armed struggle between Dai Nippon Seisantou and Rounoutou"
 jap_elective.36.d: "The Dai Nippon Seisantou, Great Japan production Party and Rounoutou, the Japanese Labor Peasant Party are in opposition all over Japan. In a rent dispute in a village in Tochigi County, both parties involved in the incident had a quarrel. Members of the production Party insulted Aki Minoriko, president of the Labor and Peasants Party, as a "red bandit peasant woman" and a "national thief", while members of the Labor and Peasants Party called Hinanawi Tenshi a "fascist aristocrat" and a "pirated Ziegfei", and both sides claimed to represent the working people and accused the other of being the enemy of the people. The spat then developed into an armed struggle, in which four members of the production party were killed and more than a dozen injured, while six people were killed and six injured by the Labor and Peasants Party."

 jap_elective.37.t: "Appointment of Naidaijin"

The former Inner Minister, Saionji Sekai, resigned due to family changes, and now the Ministry of Internal Affairs needs to appoint a new Minister of the Interior. \nOne choice is Fujiwara Chika, the sister of Field Marshal Fujiwara no Mokou, a very popular figure in political circles, and the other choice is Yakumo Ran, a close friend of the sage Yakumo Yukari. Of course, it is possible to appoint a noble Houraisan Kaguya who has no interest in party struggles, but this is afraid that the army and the sages are not satisfied."

 jap_coup.1.t: "Assemble secretly"
 jap_coup.1.d: "Today is destined to be the longest day in Japanese history, but it only starts with a few young officers eating ramen at a stall, "(chewing) Ando, what do you think we should do?" (drinking soup) it is said that someone has already tipped off the police. I am afraid it will be very risky if we continue to storm the palace according to Lord Tenshi's plan, but we will not be able to play any role if we use the so-called insurance scheme to go directly to the patriarch, and Tenshi added that the revolution would be very incomplete. ""
 jap_coup.1.a: ""Ms. Tenshi is right. We are small potatoes. No one knows that we will do it (chew).""   
 jap_coup.1.b: ""Our strength is limited and we must enlist the support of the elders.""   
 jap_coup.2.t: "Incite the squad of guards?"
 jap_coup.2.d: "Keizo Ando is ready to act, but his 1st Division has long been suspected by the government. It would be nice to assemble a thousand armed men under the noses of Tokkou, while the palace is under the protection of a fully staffed regiment of security guards, and a forcible attack will obviously lead to fatal consequences. So the other option is to be smart. Although the Empress has not mentioned it at all, Ando, as a grassroots officer, knows the situation of the Guards, and they are as resentful of the damned bureaucrats as they are, if they can get their support. The problem is that this is tantamount to "bringing security together to revolt", and the risk can be imagined."
 jap_coup.2.a: ""There is no way. Kill! ""   
 jap_coup.2.b: ""Let me go and see them first!""

 jap_coup.3.t: "The support of the old head"
 jap_coup.3.d: "Andou and others quietly visited Matara Okina, one of the three sages, and she did support changing the political status quo in Japan, as your Excellency the son of Heaven said. After that, she took the Young Yurks to visit her colleague Yakumo Yukari----, but Andou and others were temporarily placed on standby outside the Yakumo residence, where Yakumo Yukari refused without thinking about a series of "unreasonable" requests. "this is impossible. You are shaking the foundation of the country. I think you are crazy!""
 jap_coup.3.a: ""That's it, then. (The Young Turks break-in) ""  
 jap_coup.3.b: ""Then, How did she Disappeared?! ""  

 jap_coup.4.t: "It's so noisy."
 jap_coup.4.d: ""Is there fireworks outside? What time is it and do you let people go to bed? " Empress Showa turned over again, gradually covering his ears until he could not hear the noise outside. "well, this son of a bitch's palace hall is killing me, but I can't even get some sleep." While she was complaining, the bedroom door was suddenly opened by the stumbling attendant."
 jap_coup.4.a: ""Your Majesty, assassin!""

 jap_coup.5.t: "So tired"
 jap_coup.5.d: ""Hey! Where are you from? This is... Wow, what is this?! " The Empress was having a dream of shopping in Akihabara in JK clothes when he was suddenly woken up. Without saying a word, a large group of soldiers knelt in front of him and presented an "edict" written in blood for signature. "somebody help! Are you rebelling?! " She shouted a few times, but none of the attendants of the palace hall, who were usually inseparable from each other, came. "No, your Majesty, you misunderstand. We just want Japan to become greater again." "then I won't have to be in charge of the palace hall after that?""
 jap_coup.5.a: ""Ah. Of course. It's all right. ""  

 jap_coup.6.t: "Matara Okina's report."
 jap_coup.6.d: ""Ah, long time no see. So this is the situation? " The Empress was bleary-eyed and looked unconcerned even after listening to the sage's report. "Yes, your Majesty, all you have to do is sign this document." Matara Okina replied with a smile. "just as usual." Of course, the Empress didn't need her reminder at all. As soon as he twirled his signature pen and drew a picture, he couldn't wait to go back to bed. He didn't care about the stab in the back."
 jap_coup.6.a: ""What I want is this kind of uncaring attitude.""  
 jap_coup.6.b: ""Can she do a good job in politics like this?""  

 jap_coup.7.t: "Transfer troops to suppress"
 jap_coup.7.d: ""This is a coup! Get me the Minister of the Army! " Yakumo Yukari, who suddenly jump out of the window and ran away, calmed down after a roar on the phone, as if he shouldn't have gone to the Minister of the Army. The guy, though not a member of the royal school, is a real careerist who may add fuel to the fire when the situation is getting out of control. However, the direct mobilization of the army around him is clearly a challenge to his position."
 jap_coup.7.a: ""It must be done according to the rules.""  
 jap_coup.7.b: ""stop! Put me through to General Fujiwara! ""   

 jap_coup.8.t: "Yakumo Yukari's report."
 jap_coup.8.d: ""Is this the case?" The Empress was bleary-eyed and looked unconcerned even after listening to Sage's report. "Yes, the rebels were finally wiped out by the Guards, and now, your Majesty, you can go back to sleep." Yakumo Yukaripulled back the folding fan and got up and left, but turned back at the moment of stepping out the door. "this must not happen again, so I implore your Majesty to sign a document drafted by me in about an hour, so that I can better safeguard the safety of your Majesty and the Empire.""
 jap_coup.8.a: ""Ah. Yes! You bring it and I'll sign it. ""   

 jap_coup.9.t: "The new era of Japan"
 jap_coup.9.d: "With the personal support of the Empress, the radicals continue to use measures similar to attacking the imperial palace, breaking directly into the houses of politicians and forcing them to "read the edict" at gunpoint, and if they fail to do so, they will be hit by a rifle butt. When the citizens of Tokyo walked out of their homes the next morning and began to get bored, everyone was surprised to find that every street was guarded by soldiers, and there was basically a picture around them that looked like an emergency Asahi Shimbun. Several big scribbles are printed on the front page."
 jap_coup.9.a: ""A new era has begun in Japan!""  

 jap_coup.10.t: "Showa Restoration"
 jap_coup.10.d: "The Empress takes over the reins of government? This news is still a bit of a shock to the broad masses of Japanese. After all, from today on, Japan's democratic system has basically been sentenced to death. But then again, what does the power game of the upper echelons have to do with ordinary people? On the contrary, the popular slogans chanted by the widely active members of the Imperial Taoist faction on the street are quite cordial, and the view that "the Empress has been deceived", which they have been advocating before, is now widely convincing. after all, the agenda of the public trial of the "national thief" has been posted in the Asahi Shimbun, as to why yesterday's dignitaries are today's national thieves. It was approved by his Majesty the Empress. How dare you doubt it?!"
 jap_coup.10.a: ""Long live her Majesty the Empress!""  

 jap_coup.11.t: "The new Empress"
 jap_coup.11.d: "When she learned from Matara that the coup was underway, Shyotoku, who was serving in the Imperial Army, immediately asked the officer for leave and jumped on the train to Tokyo, but she thought on impulse that she had little hope of success. To put it bluntly, his Majesty is a self-contained signature device. I think even if it is a "letter of adultery for the Empress", it will be taken for granted to sign it,. As the train slowed down in thought, she looked out of the window. What the hell is this? What are you yelling at me?!"
 jap_coup.11.a: ""Long live her Majesty the Empress!"" 

 jap_coup.12.t: "The rise of Oda Nobunaga"
 jap_coup.12.d: "After hearing the changes in Tokyo from Yakumo Yukari, Oda Nobunaga quickly dispatched troops into Tokyo. After forcing the weak Imperial Taoist faction to disarm, her men blocked the main roads in the name of "eliminating the remaining rebels" and closely "protected" the mansions of major dignitaries. Then she swagger open the door of the imperial residence under the close escort of Owari's soldiers. No one knows what happened inside, but as soon as she comes out more than ten minutes later, she goes to the NHK headquarters building, and soon her voice spreads across the islands through radio channels covering all over Japan."
 jap_coup.12.a: ""I declare that the oda shogunate has been established!"" 

 jap_coup.13.t: "Smash the rebellion"
 jap_coup.13.d: "Fujiwara no Mokou's troops are about to enter Beijing when they hear the news that the rebellion had been crushed. The people of the Imperial Taoist faction, do not listen to the instructions of the sages and go straight to the imperial residence and are quickly defeated in the exchange of fire with the Guards Division. The next thing to do is to clean up the aftermath, the coup participants will be dismissed from military posts, and several leaders will be sentenced to death "succinctly". As for the conspirators, Yakumo will naturally take the opportunity to speak to the Empress to consolidate his power, and I am afraid that no one will dare to fight her again."
 jap_coup.13.a: "We must clean up the rebellious parties."

 jap_coup.15.t: "Shuotoku Restoration"
 jap_coup.15.d: ""You can't let the royal school find out that they respect the wrong person, can you?" Under the guidance of this program, Matara Okina finally decided to replace Showa. The new Empress shyotoku has served in the Army for a long time. It can be said that she is an imperial Taoist and people-friendly style. Compared with her sister, she is more likely to go out in public all the year round. It must be very appropriate for her to serve as Empress. And the incident has not caused much social upheaval as expected: as a result of showa's long-standing indifference to politics, she herself has become the object of indifference. Although the man unexpectedly ran out of the imperial house with a smile on her face after signing the abdication edict. I should have abdicated earlier."

 rw_jap.6.d: "Aya News, one of the largest comprehensive newspapers in the country, has recently begun to fight against the government. Yesterday, a journalist famous for writing exaggerated tidbits suddenly revealed in the newspaper headlines that the Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] was suspected of bribing voters in the election! The article even reveals how bribes flow to gangs, enterprises, and even trade unions in some parts of Tokyo. \nNow other large and small newspapers are scrambling to reprint the news, and because of her popularity in the press, many people are beginning to believe that her nonsense is true."

As a matter of fact, many members, including some very reputable members, are very worried that the forces of the reformers will eventually subvert Japan's democratic system. Now they have found, Sajyou Ayaka, the sister of Prime Minister Sayjou Manaka, a small potato in the political friendship association. It looks as if they are planning to carry out a coup against Prime Minister Sajou Manaka through "a direct action."

 rw_jap.8.d: "Corruption in Japanese politics has become an open secret throughout the country. As the leader of the reformers, it is naturally impossible for Prime Minister  Sajou to ignore. Just yesterday, Prime Minister Sayjou delivered a national speech, saying that he would "thoroughly crackdown" on corruption in the country. "Corruption is everywhere, from elections to the administrative system to the military," Prime Minister Sayjou said, "and there are some people who are very rich or very powerful. Their actions are very covert, and their morals are corrupt. They have hijacked his Majesty the Mikado and are interfering with my normal functions as prime minister.

As one of the founding fathers, Yakumo Yukari, a woman who was respected by  Majesty the Emperor, has now been directly exposed to corruption by reformist bureaucrats, causing a huge shock in the political arena. Now that the case has been referred to the grand court, the final judge, Shikieiki Yamaxanadu, faces a dilemma between the reformist bureaucrats and senior courtiers of the court. However, everyone is equal before the law, and it is the evidence and the impartial judgment of the judge that ultimately determine the outcome of the case."

During Oda's visit to North Korea, Prime Minister Sajou met privately with Oda's brother, Nobukatsu. After a "pleasantries", Nobukatsu revealed the information about Nobunaga's itinerary after returning to Japan. In contrast, Prime Minister Sajou promised Shinsei some military power.

Fumimaro Konoe, who has just been appointed as the "general manager" of the operation, speculates. In fact, executives drawn from those three agencies outside the prime minister's office are as wishful thinking as he is. It took a long time for Fumimaro to come out of the prime minister's office and came face to face with Tokkou's Megure Jenniuuzou, "Duke, what on earth does the prime minister want us to do?""

After publishing the program of "giving the will, empathy, and working closely with the government," she was appointed president of the new political party "IRAA (Imperial Rule Assistance Association)." Of course, this will not be as simple as the prime minister setting up a political party, while other political parties began to dissolve one after another after the news was released and declared that they were "incorporated into the IRAA". As a result, the proportion of IRAA seats in the House of Representatives increased to as much as 90% within a few days."

Now these far-left elements have put their most extreme ideas into practice. In one of the Empress's recent outings, the well-known "anarchist" Kijin Seija suddenly appeared in the crowd.

Is it too weak for the economy to trade?! That fertile land can no longer be ruled by the incompetent Chinese! Ishiwara Kanji, a famous staff officer advocating the "Manchurian Lifeline" theory, has made a detailed plan for the Korean Army and Kwantung Army as well as the Manchurian Iron Guard, and now is the time to act!

However, according to the negotiations with the Japanese consul, the Japanese government is completely unaware of this, and perhaps this is only an unauthorized action by military officers stationed abroad."
 rw_jap.19.d2: "The Japanese attacked us! There's no sign! Out of the consideration of the current relationship, the front-line officers dare not open fire on them, and our army is losing ground.

As a result, a tragedy that did not know whether it was a natural disaster or a man-made disaster occurred, and the scene was in a mess after the sudden fire, even if the fire brigade rushed to the scene to try its best to contain it. After the statistics, including the prime minister, nearly 100 Buddhists were killed, and according to the investigation of the police department, there were a large number of traces of gasoline volatilization at the scene, but there was no clue.

 rw_jap.29.d: "The three sages have long assisted his Majesty, and the small group of them has always been called the cabinet of the cabinet, but there has been a serious legal ambiguity between the powers and responsibilities of this institution. Maybe it's time to make a reasonable standard?"
 rw_jap.29.a: "This is just an informal consulting body."

 rw_jap.30.d: "Kirisame Marisa, a former foreign minister, has long been known for peace diplomacy and arms collection, and her political opponents have often launched various allegations of "possession of weapons of mass destruction". However, in a recent search, the Tokyo Police Department did not find any "weapons of mass destruction" in a search of her residence, but a sword of kusanagi."

 rw_jap.31.d: "The hypothesis that Kirisame Marisa possesses weapons of mass destruction is probably true! Recently, there was a huge explosion at Nest Duck Prison in Tokyo. More than half of the prison wall was directly blown down, resulting in a large number of prisoners escaping from the prison. About five minutes later they were controlled by the police who heard the news. However, the guy mentioned at the beginning seems to have taken advantage of the chaos to slip out of the sewer, and according to follow-up investigations, he even went home afterwards, took a large amount of cash and weapons from an undiscovered darkroom and disappeared."

Subsequently, the founder of Touhoukai, Masaru Nakano, was "kicked out", while members of other nationalist parties such as the National League led by Kazami Yuka and the Showakai led by Sumizu Yanagi were all integrated. Touhoukai has now taken on a brand new look, becoming the representative of Yakumo Group in the House of Representatives."

 rw_jap.33.t: "Separation of Assets and Operating Rights"
 rw_jap.33.d: "Although the Youkusankai has made tough demands for separating assets and operating rights and has received support from the military, the financial sector is unwilling to accept these demands. The financial community organized a meeting with representatives of the Youkusankai, and generously stated that giving the Zaibatsus appropriate freedom is beneficial to the development of the country, and pointed out that the random division and merger of enterprises will bring economic problems, and at the same time hinted that if Youkusankai would go its own way, the financial community Will no longer support Youkusankai. Although Prime Minister Sayjou had a very tough attitude at first, she was not deadheaded. Her decision was..."

 rw_jap.34.t: "Shrine Burning Movement"
 rw_jap.34.d: "Due to the anti-religious policies implemented by Oda Nobunaga after taking office, the relationship between the religious circles and the Oda military government is getting worse. In the end, the contradiction ended with the Shinto shrine burning campaign initiated by the Oda military government. About one-third of the shrines and temples in the country were burned down, and the focus was on Suwa Shrine, which was related to the former nobles. Yesterday, a group of radical military officers even tried to lead their troops to burn down the Yasukuni Shrine, while a group of conservative soldiers tried to stop it. The two sides fought under the torii gate of the Yasukuni Shrine, which ended in fruitless."
 rw_jap.34.a: "A nice burn."
 
 rw_jap.35.t: "Negotiations with the military"
 rw_jap.35.d: "Now the conflict between the government and the military must be put on the table for discussion.

The current prime minister [JAP.GetLeader] and some members of the House of Representatives urgently consulted with Yukari and revised the most unsatisfactory parts of her budget, which was called off after three days of wrangling."
 jap_cabinet.3.t: "Yakumo Yukari criticizes Prime Minister"
 jap_cabinet.3.d: "It seems that Yakumo Yukari has never appreciated a sitting prime minister, and the current prime minister [JAP.GetLeader] is no exception. At present, the sage is very dissatisfied with some of the prime minister's policy objectives, and then through her great influence, she passed a bill in the Kizuko In to transform some of the policies into what she approved. It is true that her ideas are more efficient, but this is undoubtedly ultra vires."
 jap_cabinet.4.t: "Yakumo Yukari interferes with the army"
 jap_cabinet.4.d: "Our army and navy have long disliked each other, and the sage Yakumo Yukari is probably the most dissatisfied with this. Just recently, she arranged a small joint exercise between the army and navy on the pretext of "coordinating cooperation in the services." of course, our great Imperial Army and Navy successfully ended the training as expected, but it is said that there was some unhappiness between the two sides in the course of the exercise."

The Secretary of State of the Army specially ordered a large exercise to show the strength of the Imperial Army to the sages, and since Kodoha came to power, the military budget has been skewed towards the Army, so this time in addition to regular infantry drills, the military also pulled out a lot of strange new weapons and tried a lot of new tactics really opened her eyes."
 jap_cabinet.7.t: "Matara Okina inspects the Navy"
 jap_cabinet.7.d: "Although it was a bit difficult for the navy after the cuts in military spending, they did not dare to neglect the inspection of the sages, but they did not have more enthusiasm. She always felt perfunctory when the sage and his party got off the warship, and the navy only sent a medium-sized fleet to take the observer mission around the Japanese sea, although they did well all the way without any accident. Therefore, I have no excuse to criticize."
 jap_cabinet.8.t: "Matara Okina inspects the Army Air Force"
 jap_cabinet.8.d: "The differences between the army and navy have been decided since the the restoration. One example is that the Army Air Force has the power to control all Japanese military aircraft. Obviously, the sage has strongly promoted the implementation of this policy.

 jap_cabinet.11.d: "[JAP.GetLeader] once again, Ibaraki Kasen was severely criticized by the sage., Ibaraki Kasen first attacked a series of loopholes in the current policy and then turned to the issue of [JAP.GetLeader] private life. In her view, the prime minister should live an ascetic life like her. In fact, it is good for her to supervise, but it is a bit annoying that reporters always extract some "appropriate" things from follow-up speeches."

 jap_cabinet.12.d: "Our Empress is well known for its "eclectic" behavior, and even has a reputation far beyond Japan. The week before last, she had made a well-known tidbit during her trip, while the sage Ibaraki Kasen criticized her "light" behavior at a regular meeting attended by the Empress recently. although our Empress has always turned a deaf ear to all criticism, the sage's behavior has sparked another big discussion in political circles about disrespect for standards."

This cartridge produces little recoil when fired. The Type 38 at 128 cm is a long rifle due to the emphasis on bayonet training for Japanese soldiers of this era."

His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

Thus, with the Type 14, the Imperial Army at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal has designed the Type 4 semi-automatic rifle. Charged with two 5-round stripper clips, Type 4 comes in two variants: the navy and the other for the army. The development of this weapon would give the Japanese infantryman significantly more firepower on the battlefield than previous weapons."

The gun is a monstrosity of a weapon; it has an overall length of 2.09 metres and weighs 52 kilograms (115 pounds). Capable of penetrating 30mm of armour at a range of 250 metres; it is truly a fearsome weapon in the right hands."

Exceptional amongst Japanese weapons; Type 11 is a muzzle-loaded weapon with a rifled bore."
 JAP_support_weapons2: "Type 11 LMG & Type 10 grenade discharger"
 JAP_support_weapons2_desc: "Combat experience in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 taught the Imperial Army the utility of machine guns providing covering fire. The Type 11 was developed by the famed arms designer Kijiro Nambu based on a French Hotchkiss M1909 and is air-cooled and gas-operated. A unique feature about the Type 11 machine gun is its detachable hopper; it can be refilled while attached and does not require removal during operation. The Type 10 grenade discharger was a smoothbore muzzle-loaded weapon with an incredible range of 175 metres."

 JAP_support_weapons3_desc: "The Type 99 LMG uses the new rounds found in the Arisaka Type 99. Retaining the same design as previous light machine guns and bears a resemblance to the English Enfield-Automatic. The Type 99 also allows for the attachment of a standard-issue bayonet and 2.5x telescopic sight for marksmanship. The Type 94 mortar is a heavy mortar that has a range of 4000 yards. It is intended to serve as an artillery piece that could be hauled in pieces to remote areas."
 JAP_support_weapons4: "Type 1 HMG & Type 2 12 cm Mortar"
 JAP_support_weapons4_desc: "The Type 1 is a meatgrinder of a weapon. This gas operated heavy machine gun can also be fielded as an anti-aircraft weapon. The Type 2 mortar is virtually identical to the Stokes-Brandt 81mm mortar with the only difference being that the bipod legs of the Type 2 can be removed."
 JAP_infantry_weapons2: "Model 2 submachine gun"
 JAP_infantry_weapons2_desc: "Designed by famed arms designer Kijiro Nambu, the Model 2 is a blowback-operated submachine gun. One of Japan's first attempts at a submachine gun, the Model 2 features an incredible high rate of fire while also being light and portable. A pnuematic buffer device cushions the action of the gun and acts as a bolt delay."
 JAP_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Type 100"
 JAP_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Type 100 is Japan's first mass-produced submachine gun. Although there are variants with bipods and increased sights for cavalry units, it is designed for infantry use. The gun fires 8mm at 450 rounds per minute. Interestingly some variants have been converted to folding stocks for use by army paratroopers."
 JAP_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Type 100/44"
 JAP_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "This 1944 modification of Type 100 includes several changes designed to simplify the weapon. The 1944 variant is longer than the earlier Type 100 with simple iron sights and a greatly simplified muzzle. The firing rate of the 1944 version is also considerably higher, with the gun firing at 800 rounds per minute. The gun is an absolute monster at close ranges with satisfactory accuracy and low recoil."

 JAP_train_equipment_1_desc: "While the Class D50 was well liked, the financial situation of the early 1930s led to no new freight locomotive designs until 1936. The latest freight locomotive design, the Class D51 had numerous improvements, from the use of welding, implementing a higher pressure boiler, revised cylinders, reduced axle load and overall shortening the locomotive, it proved a great step up from its predecessor."

 JAP_train_equipment_2_desc: "Based on the D51 design, the D52 incorporated numerous austerity modifications to improve the performance of the locomotive and reduce the cost of production. The design has a larger boiler and grate area, leading to higher tractive effort, while austerity considerations allow for replacing the running board with wood and looser production standards for most components."

 JAP_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "The Ki-32 is Kawasaki's successful response to the Imperial Japanese Army's tender for a completely indigenously designed and constructed aircraft. The aircraft is comparable to the German Hs 123 in terms of capability with similar speed, operating altitude and payload capacity."
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_1: "Aichi D1A2"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_1_short: "D1A2"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "The D1A is the last Japanese aircraft to be designed by a foreign company, as Aichi requested Hansa-Brandenburg to assist in the design process. Revision to the D1A produced the D1A2, improving aerodynamics and powered by a more powerful engine. Slow introduction of the succeeding Aichi D3A meant that it served well into the late 1930s, when it was considerably obsolete."
 JAP_CAS_equipment_2: "Mitsubishi Ki-51"
 JAP_CAS_equipment_2_short: "Ki-51"
 JAP_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "The successor to the Ki-32, the Ki-51 was able to mount a stronger engine, but with largely the same airframe and continuing to use non-retractable landing gears. Despite the outdated features, the biggest redeeming feature of the Ki-51 was that it was able to take off from rough airfields in Taiwan, Korea and China when many other aircraft cannot, being the defining close support aircraft Japan fielded."
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_2: "Aichi D3A"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_2_short: "D3A"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Due to the extensive problems in the first prototype, the Aichi D3A was not accepted into service until well into 1939. The revised aircraft proved better than the Nakajima D3N1, but some directional instability remained until 1940. After resolving this problem, the D3A was found to be highly manoeuvrable compared to other aircraft of similar roles, especially planes used by the Imperial Japanese Army."
 JAP_CAS_equipment_3: "Manshū Ki-98"
 JAP_CAS_equipment_3_short: "Ki-98"
 JAP_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "The unconventionally designed Ki-98 utilises a pusher propeller system and a 2,000 horsepower Mitsubishi engine to reach a top speed of 730 km/h. Originally designed as a high-altitude interceptor, its highly responsive control system made it also suitable for ground-attack, and the 37mm nose-mounted cannon proved to be more than capable of attacking armoured targets in China and Southern Asia."
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_3: "Yokosuka D4Y Suisei"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_3_short: "D4Y Suisei"
 JAP_cv_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Demand and design for a new Carrier-capable dive bomber started in 1940, but a lack of available design staff significantly delayed the introduction of the D4Y Suisei. Early prototypes used a dubiously license-produced German inline engine, while later models returned to radial engines. A slim and highly streamlined fuselage allowed it to reach high speeds in horizontal flight and in dives. This, combined with excellent manoeuvrability, gave the Suisei superior performance to contemporary dive bombers, only losing out in payload capacity."

 JAP_fighter_equipment_0: "Nakajima Type 91"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_0_short: "Type 91"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "Designed in 1935, the Type 91 suffered numerous initial teething issues of poor directional stability and centre of gravity. This caused a delay into service until late into 1935 and only entered into widespread service in 1936. Despite the initial problems, the Type 91 was a competent fighter and highly respected."
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_0: "Nakajima A4N"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_0_short: "A4N"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "The A4N incorporated a 730 hp engine as well as an all-metal design, adapting the Army's Ki-10 fighter and returning to a biplane design. Command staff and pilots significantly preferred the more conventional biplane design even if it sacrificed performance, compared to Mitsubishi's 7-shi carrier fighter prototype which crashed during testing."
 JAP_fighter_equipment_1: "Nakajima Ki-27"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Ki-27"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Just as the Type 91 was introduced, the Imperial Japanese Army was already looking for a monoplane replacement, but with the same armament of two light machine guns. The Ki-27 proved to be able to turn just as tightly as the preceding Type 91 with a low wing loading while also being faster."
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi A5M"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_1_short: "A5M"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "After producing a disappointing prototype for the 7-shi carrier fighter tender, Mitsubishi refined the design and produced the A5M. The new plane featured thin elliptical, inverted gull wings and a fixed undercarriage, becoming one of the first monoplanes to be deployed atop carriers."
 JAP_fighter_equipment_2: "Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Ki-43 Hayabusa"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "First built in 1939, the Ki-43 was a disappointment to many pilots, but a progressive series of modifications to the fighter significantly improved its performance, which made it the most popular land-based fighter of the Imperial Japanese Army with its high climb rate and manoeuvrability. However, despite the modifications, little was done to improve the firepower of the Hayabusa, as it only mounted two rifle calibre machine guns."
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_2: "Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_2_short: "A6M Rei-sen"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Just as the revolutionary Mitsubishi A5M started to enter service, the IJN started to look for a successor, with detailed specifications calling for a highly capable and heavily armed fighter. Nakajima pulled out of the competition after reviewing the specifications, while Mitsubishi persevered. The A6M improved on the A5M in all but low-speed manoeuvrability, impressing navy pilots with the overall outstanding capabilities."
 JAP_fighter_equipment_3: "Nakajima Ki-84 Hayate"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Ki-84 Hayate"
 JAP_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Despite the praise the Ki-43 Hayabusa received, pilots reported disappointment over the survivability, speed and armament. The Ki-84 was designed to remedy such issues, and excelled at its role. Armed with up to four 20mm cannons, it is reportedly one of the best fighters of its era one could pilot."
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_3: "Mitsubishi A7M Reppū"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_3_short: "A7M Reppū"
 JAP_cv_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Ambitious admirals of the Imperial Japanese Navy sent out a tender for an even more capable aircraft than the A6M Rei-sen not long after its introduction. Mitsubishi's answer to the bid is the Reppū, with a wider wingspan, more powerful engine and significantly heavier armament compared to the A6M."

 JAP_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "After a German defector provided pictures and preliminary design plans of the Bf 262 to Japanese intelligence officers, the IJNAF was highly interested. Nakajima, having received a copy of these documents, sought to build their own. They cooperated with Ishikawajima to build the Ne-20 turbojet engine, and designed the aircraft to be more conventional compared to the Bf 262 with straight wings and a more aerodynamic fuselage. The resulting J9N Unryū would superficially resemble the Bf 262, but was otherwise a completely indigenous design."
 JAP_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Kyūshū J7W Shinden-Kai"
 JAP_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "J7W Shinden-Kai"
 JAP_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The J7W Shinden was designed to mount a radial engine, but the potential of mounting a turbojet engine was also kept in mind, such as the Ishikawajima Ne-20 that was still being tested. When the turbojet engines proved their worth on the J9N Unryū, the concept was realised, and the J7W1 mounted the improved Nakajima Ne-230 engines with improvements to the fighter's armament in the form of another pair of 30mm cannons."

 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi G3M1"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "G3M1"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "After Mitsubishi bargained with Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku for backing the G3M project due to its disappointing first flight, the G3M1 was produced. Revisions to the airframe were made to allow it to carry torpedoes in addition to the standard payload of bombs. After the modifications were made, the G3M1's speed and range were unrivalled by any other great power's aircraft."
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Nakajima B5N"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "B5N"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The B5N is the first single wing torpedo bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy, proving to be substantially faster than other models in service, but also highly vulnerable to enemy fire. It was lightly armed with only a single rear facing machine gun, but the carrying capacity and speed of the aircraft remained highly competitive among contemporaries."
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Mitsubishi G4M"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "G4M"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "A further development on the G3M, demanding even longer range and higher speed, the G4M proved to be a worthy successor. It was able to carry a larger payload than the G3M, as well as capable of achieving a higher altitude and speed."
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Nakajima B6N Tenzan"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "B6N Tenzan"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "The B6N design was based on its predecessor B5N, improving the speed and payload capacity without significantly changing the airframe. The engine was replaced with a Mitsubishi model, which improved the Tenzan's speed, but did little to remedy the weak defensive armament and vulnerability to enemy fire."
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Yokosuka P1Y Ginga"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "P1Y Ginga"
 JAP_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The 15-shi design specifications demanded a bomber capable of accompanying the A6M Rei-sen fighters with the same armament of the preceding G4M. The P1Y Ginga would be highly streamlined, allowing it to achieve a speed rivalling single engine fighters during testing. This aircraft would serve mainly as a land-based naval bomber, with variants substituting as a night fighter and interceptor due to the high speed."
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Aichi B7A Ryūsei"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "B7A Ryūsei"
 JAP_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The B7A Ryūsei was designed to be used aboard Japan's new generation of aircraft carriers. The distinctive inverted gull wing allowed it to carry the same payload as a B6N Tenzan but at a noticeably higher speed with much more responsive control surfaces. It also broke Japan's tradition of not mounting forward facing defensive armament on attack aircraft, with two 20mm cannons placed in the wing roots."

 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Kawasaki Ki-38"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Ki-38"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "The Ki-38 was a private venture by Kawasaki as a response to the development of twin-engine heavy fighters in Europe, such as the Bf 110. After the IJA was informed of the design and inspected the wooden mock up, they ordered a number to be built and flight tested. Initial testing revealed the plane to be severely underpowered, which was somewhat remedied by fitting the Nakajima Ha-25. The design would see service over the Southeastern Pacific as a long-range patrol aircraft."
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryū"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Ki-45 Toryū"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "To improve the performance of the Ki-38, a series of modifications were supposed to be made. However after realising that the engine would not be powerful enough to propel the aircraft after the modifications, a new plan was drawn up. The resultant aircraft would be reworked so significantly that it was essentially a new plane, and thus it was given a new designation."
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Kawasaki Ki-102"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Ki-102"
 JAP_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Despite externally resembling a Ki-45 Toryū, the Ki-102 was significantly more lethal compared to its predecessor. The 37mm Ho-204, and the later 57mm Ho-401 cannon, mounted in the nose made it a formidable aircraft when it came to bomber interception, where even a short firing pass could rip the sturdiest bombers' wing off."

 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Mitsubishi Ki-2"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "Ki-2"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "The Ki-2 is a Japanese adaptation of a Swedish bomber, originally designed as a German Junkers mail plane. The plane served well in reconnaissance roles and conducting light bombing. Despite being obsolete when introduced, it was still used until the end of the 1930s as a trainer."
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi G3M"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "G3M"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The G3M was envisioned as a fast high-altitude all-purpose bomber for the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, the underpowered Hiro Type 91 engine meant that the aircraft could not reach its projected cruising speed, let alone the operating altitude. Mitsubishi would continue to modify the aircraft, but backing from within the Navy was lacking after a disappointing first flight. It necessitated intervention from Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku to make sure the aircraft entered service and was able to prove itself."
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Kawasaki Ki-48 Sōkei"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Ki-48 Sōkei"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Experience from developing the Ki-38 and Ki-45 project proved valuable when designing the Ki-48. The plane was lighter than its fighter counterparts and had little technical issues, with satisfactory payload capacity. Dive bomber pilots were surprised by how responsive the controls were and the capability for the aircraft to perform dive bombing."
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Mitsubishi Ki-67 Hiryū"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "Ki-67 Hiryū"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "Ambitious specifications for a successor to the Ki-48 Sōkei demanded the successor to be heavily armed to fend off interceptors, capable of high speeds and dive bombing as well as the ability to survive heavy battle damage. The resultant Ki-67 would have significantly better survivability compared to contemporary Japanese aircraft with self-sealing fuel tanks and many armour plates protecting the crew."
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Yokosuka R2Y2 Keiun-Kai"
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "R2Y2 Keiun-Kai"
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The disappointing performance estimates of the R1Y led to a new design being commissioned by the IJN, which resulted in the R2Y, mounting the Aichi Ha-70 compound engine. An additional study led to the R2Y mounting two Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines and with extra hardpoints on the revised wings. The newly added hardpoints made the Keiun a highly capable high-speed tactical bomber."
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Nakajima Ki-190 Ryūjin"
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Ki-190 Ryūjin"
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "A modification of the Ki-67 Hiryū, the Army sought to improve the aircraft's speed further by mounting a pair of Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines. Initial mechanical issues aside, the Ki-190 Ryūjin achieved well in excess of 900 kmph for maximum speed during testing and was quickly adopted by the IJA. It would retain many of the features of the Ki-67 Hiryū, while enjoying the high speed provided by a turbojet engine."

 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi Ki-21"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Ki-21"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "After the initial testing and competition with the Nakajima Ki-19 design, the Ki-21 was proved to be better, having better speed. However, production was slow and the type only entered widespread service in 1939, by which the aircraft was considerably outdated and obsolete."
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_2: "Nakajima Ki-49 Donryū"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Ki-49 Donryū"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Designed to replace the Ki-21, the Donryū was heavily armed for Japanese standard, with half a dozen light machine guns and a cannon mounted in the rear, while being capable of a higher speed and longer range than bombers in other nations."
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_3: "Nakajima G8N Renzan"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_3_short: "G8N Renzan"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "Despite disastrous results during initial testing and the third prototype accidentally catching fire and being destroyed, the G8N Renzan was one of the most well liked bombers. Fitted with the best turbocharger produced by Hitachi, the Renzan was able to reach a higher altitude than most Japanese aircraft, while the range or speed was comparable to any escort fighters."
 JAP_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Nakajima G12N Shōri"
 JAP_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "G12N Shōri"
 JAP_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Due to the promising results of the turbo jet engine programme, the IJN requested the mechanically plagued G10N Fugaku to utilise the Nakajima Ne-230 engine. This necessitated significant rehauling of the airframe and the resulting aircraft was unrecognisable from the Fugaku, essentially being a new design, thus given a new designation and christened the Shōri."

 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi Ki-46"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_1_short: "Ki-46"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_1_desc: "A lightly armed and fast aircraft, it outperformed the fighters in service at the time of its introduction, but an even more powerful engine was fitted afterwards. It took well into 1939 for an aircraft that was widely produced to be able to catch up to a Ki-46."
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_2: "Nakajima J1N1-C"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_2_short: "J1N1-C"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_2_desc: "Originally designed as a long-ranged bomber escort, the J1N1 Gekkō was forced into the role of an reconnaissance aircraft after most aircraft firms refused to design a dedicated aircraft due to being overloaded with designing or improving other aircraft. Nakajima suggested modifying the J1N1 Gekkō, and removed most of the forward facing armament, improving the aircraft's speed by a noticeable margin."

 JAP_transport_plane_equipment_1: "Nakajima Ki-34"
 JAP_transport_plane_equipment_1_short: "Ki-34"

 JAP_rocket_suicide_equipment_1: "Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka"
 JAP_rocket_suicide_equipment_1_short: "Ohka"
 JAP_rocket_suicide_equipment_1_desc: "The Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka was a purpose-built, rocket powered human-guided anti-shipping attack plane, designed to be employed should the tides of war turn against Japan's favour."
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1: "Mitsubishi J8M Shūsui"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1_short: "J8M Shūsui"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1_desc: "After much difficulty, the Japanese intelligence services managed to sneak out a number of design plans for a rocket-powered interceptor from Germany. The design plans were inspected by both the IJA and IJN, and the Navy went on to commission Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to reverse engineer a copy of the aircraft, which became the J8M Shūsui, with similar performances to its contemporaries."
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2: "Mitsubishi Ki-202 Shūsui-Kai"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_short: "Ki-202 Shūsui-Kai"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_desc: "Typical to the interservice rivalry between the IJA and IJN, the two forces disagreed on the design for the interceptor, with the IJN favouring ditching a cannon for extra fuel tanks and the IJA preferring widening the aircraft instead. Thus, the IJA ordered an independent development of the Navy's J8M Shūsui, widening the wings and creating the Ki-202 Shūsui-Kai."
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3: "Mizuno Ki-156 Shinryū"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_short: "ki-156 Shinryū"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_desc: "The possibilities of ultra-high altitude strategic bombers bombing the Japanese mainland worried the Japanese High Command, and as such, they assigned the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal to investigate the possibilities of a high altitude interceptor. The original specifications were then modified to use the successful Mitsubishi Toko-Ro.2 rocket motor also mounted on the J8M Shūsui, with an additional demand of being able to act as a glider. This would result in the Ki-156 Shinryū, partially designed and manufactured by Mizuno, a sports equipment company that also built gliders."
