 #Infantry Equip

 GER_infantry_equipment_0: "Gewehr Modell 98"
 GER_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser G. 98"
 GER_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Gewehr 98 (Rifle 98) was the standard German infantry weapon of the Weltkrieg. It is a good example of the type of military rifle designed around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when rifle development reached fever pitch. In common with other armies, the German infantry carried a full length rifle, while other troops were issued with shorter carbines. The bolt and magazine system of the Gewehr 98 was designed by the Mauser company, although the rifle was produced under licence by a number of other commercial manufacturers. It was a well-made and accurate weapon, but was not well suited to trench warfare."
 #Mauser Standardmodell :
 GER_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabiner Modell 98 Ausführung B"
 GER_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser Kar. 98b"
 GER_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs."
 GER_infantry_equipment_2: "Selbstladegewehr Modell 40"
 GER_infantry_equipment_2_short: "S.G. 40"
 GER_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by the Mauser company in response to a desire of the German Army for a self-loading rifle with a backup bolt action, the Selbstladegewehr 40 is a massive leap forward in German small arms design. While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the Heer eventually dropped some of its other specific requirements for the rifle. The end result was the initial prototype with only a few design edits, and it proved effective."
 GER_infantry_equipment_3: "Maschinenkarabiner Modell 42"
 GER_infantry_equipment_3_short: "M.Kb. 42"
 GER_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Maschinenkarabiner 42 is a revolutionary design chambered for a new intermediate cartridge, developed by famous German arms designer Hugo Schmeisser, in conjunction with the Haenel company. While the first prototype of the rifle was prone to jamming, both the military and even the Kaiser himself were extremely enthusiastic about the project, and immense resources were concentrated on improving the design, with the rifle deemed ready for adoption in 1942."
 #G33/40:
 GER_infantry_weapons2: "Gewehr Modell 98/38"
 GER_infantry_weapons2_short: "G. 98/38"
 GER_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Gewehr 98/38, also simply known as the G. 98/38, is a bolt-action rifle, sometimes considered a carbine, and based heavily on the Gewehr 98. The rifle is rather short, at only one metre long. Originally designed for the Mountain troops, the G. 98/38 was soon adopted by other German forces, including some cavalry and infantry regiments."
 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 40"
 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "M.P. 40"
 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The M.P. 40, sometimes incorrectly called 'Schmeisser', was developed by Heinrich Vollmer and based on M.P. 38, with the aim of equipping German soldiers with an assault weapon. It uses magazines of 32 cartridges of 9mm, with its effective range being about 100-150 metres. It is a very reliable and particularly economical weapon to manufacture, usually used by officers, mechanised infantry and paratroopers."
 #StG 44:
 GER_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Maschinenkarabiner Modell 44"
 GER_advanced_infantry_weapons2_short: "M.Kb. 44 'Sturmgewehr'"
 GER_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Maschinenkarabiner 44 is the outcome of the German need to provide infantrymen with heavier firepower from their rifles. As a result of the continuous development of M.Kb. 42, the M.Kb. 44 is devoid of many of the disadvantages of the previous design and is even sometimes called the 'Sturmgewehr' - the assault rifle. The final design has a shorter range than contemporary rifles due to German research that most of the combat in the European War takes place at distances less than 300 metres. At the sacrifice of range, close range firepower was greatly improved."

 GER_infantry_at_desc: "The Panzerabwehrrohr is the brainchild of Dr. Heinrich Langweiler, in response to an urgent requirement for a light one-shot throw-away infantry weapon with which infantry could use to tackle the growing numbers of enemy heavy and medium tanks, that are frequently overwhelming German defences. The range of the first Panzerabwehrrohr was only 30 metres, which made their use somewhat hazardous, until more developed variants with increased range came to production."

 GER_infantry_at2_desc: "The Raketenpanzerbüchse 54 shoulder-launched anti-tank rocket launchers, nicknamed 'Ofenrohr' ('stove pipe') and the more popular 'Panzerschreck' ('Tank's Fright'), are lightweight infantry weapons developed for the German military, inspired by the rumours about American rocket launchers. Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks' armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers. As a drawback, the R.Pz.B. 54 produces a lot of smoke upon firing."

 GER_motorized_equipment_1_desc: "The German Army in the early 1930s had more than 100 different vehicle designs in service, leading to massive logistical difficulties. In order to standardise their vehicle fleet, they opted for a commercial truck design by Adam Opel AG of Brandenburg to become their standard cargo truck. With only slight modifications to meet military requirements, presented in 1930, the Opel Blitz was accepted in service with designation Kraftfahrzeug 305 and by 1936 became the main truck of the German Army. Although well built, the Kfz.305 suffers from being rather too complicated for reliability in the rugged conditions, but still has better performance than other German trucks."

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen “Kätzchen” (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

Ordered in 1935 for use by German Army engineers, the Landwasserschlepper (Land Water Tractor) was intended as a lightweight river tug with some capacity to operate on land. Designed by Borsig of Düsseldorf, the hull of the L.W.S. is similar to that of a motor launch, resembling a tracked boat with twin rear-mounted tunnelled propellers and twin rudders. On land, it moves on steel-shod tracks with four bogies per side."

Initially developed in 1932 as 6 wheels variants, it was obvious that this variant will be obsolete in the nearest future. In 1937 the 8 wheels variant armed with 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon was introduced in service. The all-wheel drive four-axle Sd.Kfz. 231 are one of the most technically advanced armoured vehicles and are able to operate on rough terrain, with a cross-country comparable to that of tanks."

 GER_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 GER_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 GER_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 GER_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 GER_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 GER_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 GER_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 GER_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 GER_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 GER_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 GER_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Mainly due to its short wingspan and easy maintenance work, the Imperial Navy too decided against the Fi 98 and instead ordered the Hs 123. Used by both branches of the Heer, spare parts are easier and cheaper to acquire making the Hs 123 T, some armed with torpedoes, popular among the Admiralty."
 GER_CAS_equipment_2: "Henschel Erdkampfflugzeug 129"
 GER_CAS_equipment_2_short: "Hs 129"
 GER_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Having realised the need to upgrade from the outdated biplane design of the Hs 123, the Supreme Army Command ordered a new design for ground-attack airplanes. Designed for interdiction of materiel and logistics, the plane had to be thickly armoured for its low-level head-on strafing runs. While initially Henschel used a low power Argus engine it was later switched to a higher power BMW engine, eventually leading to serial production of the aircraft. Due to its high calibre cannon it is often referred to as 'Büchsenöffner' ('can opener') among the troops."
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_2: "Henschel Träger-Schlachtflugzeug 129"
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_2_short: "Hs 129 T"
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "The Admiralty, having seen the successes of the Hs 129 quickly adopted the design to phase out the old Hs 123. The new design, albeit focused on ground attacks, proved to work well for torpedo attacks and the thick armour makes the planes very durable against anti-aircraft fire and dogfights."
 GER_CAS_equipment_3: "Dornier Jagdbomber 355"
 GER_CAS_equipment_3_short: "Do 355"
 GER_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Seeing the need to replace the old Henschel planes, the High Command ordered the design of new ground attack planes. Dornier, known for his exceptional designs, won the war ministry over, with this unorthodox but highly aerodynamic style. Unlike other planes the Do 355 has one propeller at the front and one at the back as well as its engine behind the cockpit which allows for higher performance and a better roll rate than other aircraft."
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_3: "Dornier Träger-Jagdbomber 355"
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_3_short: "Do 355 T"
 GER_cv_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Having observed the superior agility and armament the Do 355 offers, the Imperial Navy decided to phase out it's older carrier variants and to invest in the development and construction of the new carrier based, light bomber aircraft."

 GER_fighter_equipment_0_short: "Ff 68"
 GER_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "Designed to replace the Ff 65, the Ff 68 met the most optimistic expectations in terms of handling and agility from the outset. Victory in a training battle against its main competitor Hb 51 finally confirmed the Ff 68 as the next German fighter. While now are mainly outdated planes (despite objections from the Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen side), they are still used as the night fighters by the German military."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_0: "Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen Träger-Jagdflugzeug 68"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_0_short: "Ff 68 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "A well liked biplane, the Ff 68 was selected into service aboard the Kaiserliche Marine's aircraft carriers. Little modification was needed to make them suitable for carrier service, and much like their ground-based counterparts, it received high praise by carrier crews for its docile control characteristics."
 GER_fighter_equipment_1: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Jagdflugzeug 109"
 GER_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf 109"
 GER_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke responded to a fighter tender with the modern mono-plane Bf 109 design. Despite the generally accepted point of view in German military circles that a fighter must necessarily be a biplane, the Bf 109 fighter, mounting the DB 600 engine, was accepted in service due to its heavier armament and significantly higher top speed compared with other designs, not to mention the ability of recovering from the spin almost at any time."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_1: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Träger-Jagdflugzeug 109"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf 109 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "With the significantly improved knowledge of aerodynamics and engine performance, the Kaiserliche Marine sent out contracts for a new carrier-borne aircraft. Unsurprisingly, they selected the Bf 109 that won the contract issued by the Heer. Modifications were made to ensure that it was carrier capable, including the wings and control surfaces being lengthened, fitting tailhooks and catapult fittings, as well as the implementation of foldable wingtips."
 GER_fighter_equipment_2: "Focke-Wulf Jagdflugzeug 190"
 GER_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Fw 190"
 GER_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Difficulties to produce enough Daimler-Benz inline engines and successes of using radial engines in fighter designs by other nations, made the prospects of building a radial engine powered fighter promising. Developed by the personal initiative of Kurt Waldemar Tank, the chief engineer of Focke-Wulf, the Fw 190 design is notable for the survivability of the structure, ease of management, widespread use of modular assembly methods and ease of maintenance. Outperforming the still good Bf 109, but having child diseases of engine and concerning pilots with its armament, the new fighter was accepted in service after initial tests."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_2: "Focke-Wulf Träger-Jagdflugzeug 190"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Fw 190 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Due to limits of the Bf 109 airframe such as a weak and problematic gear leg, made a new fighter platform necessary and difficulties in developing the Bf 155 project means that producing a purpose-built carrier-borne fighter is out of the question. A conversion of the latest fighter aircraft, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 was selected. Modifications were made, much like the Bf 109 T, fitting tailhooks and catapult fittings."

 GER_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Fw 152"
 GER_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "By early 1944, it became apparent that the development potential of the Fw 190 with the BMW 801 engine had dwindled. This became even more apparent with the advent of the new enemy fighters. A heavily modified Fw 190, the Fw 152 design development started in 1942 and has such features as increased fuel tanks alongside with speed and much heavier armament compared with the Fw 190. It's outstanding performance and ensuing popularity with the crews made it the poster child of Germany's air forces."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_3: "Focke-Wulf Träger-Jagdflugzeug 152"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Fw 152 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "With far too many technical issues plaguing the Bf 155, as well as diminishing performance improvement compared to the fighters in service and over-commitment by Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the project for a dedicated carrier fighter is cancelled. For a new generation of carrier fighter, it necessitated selecting and modifying a new land-based fighter. The Fw 152 combined the best of both the Bf 109 and the Fw 190, and is well suited for modification and service."
 GER_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Jagdflugzeug 262"
 GER_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf 262"

 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Created as a heavy fighter aircraft with more range than the Bf 109, the Air Service conducted a competition which was won by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke. Additionally to the advantage in range the armament of the Bf 110 is unusually strong - consisting of three 20mm cannons in the front. Even though less agile it proves to be an exceptional airplane, especially suited for use in our colonial holdings."
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Junkers Zerstörer 88"
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Ju 88"
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Initially designed to be a fast bomber, the Ju 88 can fit into many roles, including air supremacy and interception missions. Chosen to succeed the Bf 110, it is more aerobatic and agile and capable of covering a larger air area than its predecessor."

 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_desc: "Designed as a successor to the Bf 163 and the Bf 263, the Fi 349 tried to improve various shortcomings of the other interceptors. The aircraft only needs one pilot with basic training in aiming and firing, as it would be guided by an autopilot. Additionally after the attack the pilot does not need to return to an airstrip to land, but rather is ejected and lands with a parachute. This revolutionary design allows any common man to fly the plane should the need arise."
