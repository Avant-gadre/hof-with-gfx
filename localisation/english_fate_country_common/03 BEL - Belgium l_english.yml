##Equip-air
 BEL_CAS_equipment_1: "Sabca-Caproni 47"
 BEL_CAS_equipment_1_short: "S.47"
 BEL_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "This close air support aircraft suffered in 1940 from an insufficient speed, making it an easy target, and an insufficient payload, making the destruction of the bridges of the Canal Albert impossible for the poor pilots assigned on those last chance missions."
 BEL_CAS_equipment_2: "Renard 37 B 14N"
 BEL_CAS_equipment_2_short: "R-37 B"
 BEL_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "The Renard 37 B is a biplane variant of the R37 for ground attacks, as only a prototype of the fighter version was built, it stayed on paper and was never made."

 BEL_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "R-37 DC AN"
 BEL_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "First revision of the R36 prototype, the Renard 37 only existed on paper. But there is a 'défense côtière' (coastal defence) version among the plans."

 BEL_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Renard 42"
 BEL_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "R-42"
 BEL_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The R-42 is a twin fighter long range variant of the R-36 and subsequent designs (R-38, R-40), an idea later developed in the American F-82 Twin Mustang. Due to the war it was only sketched."

 BEL_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "LACAB GR.8"
 BEL_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "GR.8"
 BEL_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "The GR.8, nicknamed 'Doryphore' (meaning 'Potato Bug' because of its poor flying capabilities) was made in order to serve as a multipurpose aircraft for the Belgian air force. Supposed to serve as a bomber, a reconnaissance aircraft and a heavy fighter it followed the ludicrous demands of the Belgian army to the letter... and was consequently bad in all of those roles."
 BEL_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "SABCA S.45"
 BEL_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "SABCA S.45"
 BEL_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The SABCA S.45 is a licence built Caproni Ca.135 to enable a greater production of planes than Italy's limited capabilities. With this experience in bomber building the Belgian could have easily built more of those for their own use, but they never did."

 BEL_light_tank_equipment_1: "CLR T15"
 BEL_light_tank_equipment_1_short: "T15"
 BEL_light_tank_equipment_1_desc: "While Germany was at first miffed by the Flandro-Walloon selection of a highly modified Canadian Vicker's Mark III for its first light tank since the Weltkrieg-era FT, fears of creeping Canadian influence were squashed when the country placed substantial orders for German armaments, engines, and more for the new vehicle. After some initial frustrations, the vehicle would enter service as the T15."

 BEL_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_short: "SA 76mm"
 BEL_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The SA 76 is a peculiar looking vehicle if ever there was one. Little more than a Canadian Vickers tankette fitted with a comically oversized 76mm gun, this ugly duckling packs a mighty punch despite glaring weaknesses."

 BEL_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_1: "T13"
 BEL_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_short: "T13"
 BEL_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc: "Due to the favourable reception of Canadian Vickers tankettes and German pressure for Flandro-Walloon government to sever ties with Canadian manufacturers, when the need arose to adopt a tank destroyer, a design from a small arms manufacturer near Hainaut was selected due mostly to its similarities to familiar Canadian designs. The vehicle is armed with the same 47mm anti-tank gun already in service with the army."
 BEL_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_2: "T13 B3"
 BEL_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_short: "T13 B3"
 BEL_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc: "The T13 B3, while indeed an evolution of older T13 designs, bears little resemblance to those vehicles. Sporting both a turret and new 75mm gun on a completely redesigned chassis, the B3 may as well be a new vehicle entirely."

Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent. Capable of carrying eight soldiers in addition to towing a gun or a trailer, the truck became the main vehicle of panzergrenadiers."

 BEL_mechanized_equipment_2_desc: "Developed on the chassis of Sd.Kfz. 11, the Schützenpanzerwagen Sonderkraftfahrzeug 251 half-tracks (commonly referred to as "SWP") are built by Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG specifically to quickly transport a squad of infantrymen to the front lines with adequate armour protection from small arms fire. The truck examples are usually assigned to armour units for the purpose of helping troops stay right behind the fast moving tanks."

 BEL_mechanized_equipment_3_desc: "In late 1943, the German Army asked Auto-Union to develop a light, fully tracked reconnaissance vehicle, capable of carrying 6-8 men in an open-top superstructure. Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

 BEL_train_equipment_1_desc: "Originally built as the Prussian P 8 for the Prussian state railways, the Type 64 were purchased from Germany after the Great War as the newly reorganised Flanders-Wallonia found themselves lacking suitable rolling stock for mixed traffic service. Later, a licence to produce them domestically was acquired, allowing the production of the Type 64 locally."

 BEL_train_equipment_2_short: "SNCB Type 1"
 BEL_train_equipment_2_desc: "Built for heavy express passenger services, the Type 1 locomotives were not prepared for war time freight service. However, the lack of an alternative meant that they were pushed into freight service regardless. The locomotive would see heavy usage around the Belgian network, supplementing the other German locomotives acquired from Germany."
