 tooltip_escort_ships: "Escort Ships"
 MEX_focus_blue_water_navy: "Blue Water Navy"
 MEX_focus_blue_water_navy_desc: "Mexico has never been a naval power. In colonial times, our Spanish overlords needed all their ships to face the British.

 tooltip_capital_ships: "Capital Ships"
 MEX_focus_raiding_navy: "Raiding Navy"
 MEX_focus_raiding_navy_desc: "We can't hope to catch up with the major naval powers of the world in contesting the surface against battleships and carriers. We should instead try to interdict enemy troop transports before they arrive to protect Mexico from invasion."

 MEX_focus_aerial_artillery_desc: "We experimented with the use of bombers against 'soft' targets during the Cristero War, and numerous other rebellions by unruly generals.

 MEX_focus_agricultural_credit_bank_desc: "The Banco de Crédito Agricola will help speed up the land reform program by giving loans to ejido farmers with which to buy machinery and other capital goods.

 MEX_focus_rural_infrastructure: "Rural Infrastructure"
 MEX_focus_rural_infrastructure_desc: "The rail systems in Mexico were expanded during the Díaz era, but concentrated mostly in the Northern cities so as to facilitate trade with America. We should push the railways further south."
 MEX_focus_peripheral_infrastructure: "Peripheral Infrastructure"

 MEX_focus_rural_schools: "Rural Schools"
 MEX_focus_rural_schools_desc: "The schools are where we turn the raw material of illiterate peasants into patriotic citizens willing to fight injustice and strengthen the Fatherland.

 MEX_focus_rent_freeze: "Rent Freeze"
 MEX_focus_rent_freeze_desc: "The urban laborers are a key constituent in the new Mexico we are building.

 MEX_focus_confederation_of_mexican_workers: "Confederation of Mexican Workers"
 MEX_focus_confederation_of_mexican_workers_desc: "The political elite in Mexico have alway sought to control trades union activities. The CTM will replace the CROM, as the latter is seen as corrupt and discredited by association with unpopular past leaders of the regime."
 MEX_focus_ejido_worker_militias: "Ejido Worker Militias"
 MEX_focus_ejido_worker_militias_desc: "The land reform promised in the Constitution of 1917 has seen slow progress. Often, landlords use thugs and private armies to intimidate their tenants to prevent redistribution. Let us organize the peasants, farmers and laborers into communal militias to protect the gains we are making against injustice."
 MEX_focus_party_of_the_revolution: "Party of the Revolution"
 MEX_focus_party_of_the_revolution_desc: "President Cárdenas was elected on a platform of agrarian reform thanks to the support of worker and peasant organizations. We have implemented the reforms and now have a proud socialist nation ready to fight injustice on the international stage."
 MEX_focus_liberalize_the_banking_sector: "Liberalize the Banking Sector"
 MEX_focus_liberalize_the_banking_sector_desc: "There are many heavy-handed government policies preventing the market from transforming Mexico. The 1925 General Law of Credit Institutions, for example, prevents banks from owning shares in other banks. Ridiculous! The freer the market, the freer the people. Luis Montes de Oca, an advocate of the Austrian School of Economics, will help us reform the banking system."
 MEX_focus_strike_breaking: "Strike Breaking"
 MEX_focus_strike_breaking_desc: "Unionization is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution of 1917, but attacks on property are criminal and should be treated as such. Withdrawing labor from a critical industry could even be perceived as treasonous in a time of crisis."
 MEX_focus_urban_development: "Urban Development"
 MEX_focus_urban_development_desc: "The cities are the center of economic activity and therefore must have their needs prioritized over the backwards rural states. We will build up the road and rail systems in Mexico City and the other major urban areas, and in doing so the wealth of Mexico will increase even more."
 MEX_focus_cientifico_camarilla: "Científico Camarilla"
 MEX_focus_cientifico_camarilla_desc: "The Díaz regime was supported by a clique of technocrats in the cabinet and private business. The unpopular clientelism and patronage systems they established were one reason the regime collapsed. However, we have the love and support of the people, and the Científicos have some much needed skills..."
 MEX_focus_end_land_reform: "End Land Reform"
 MEX_focus_end_land_reform_desc: "The land reform program has long been abused by local strongmen with political connections or military power. A wealthy farmer stealing public land for his own gain doesn't help make Mexico stronger or more united. That land should instead be sold to the highest bidder. Perhaps some landlords do abuse their tenants, but that is a matter for the courts."
 MEX_focus_privatization: "Privatization"
 MEX_focus_privatization_desc: "The ejido system places restrictions on the use of land, depending upon the use intended by the government. Why should the state force farmers into subsistence rather than growing cash crops for export? We can make Mexico wealthier if we break up the communal farms and allow real development to take place. Antiquated notions of self-reliance only stand in the way of progress and globalization."
 MEX_focus_caudillo_private_armies: "Caudillo Private Armies"
 MEX_focus_caudillo_private_armies_desc: "The governors, businessmen and garrison commanders in a region tend to be the same man - a Revolutionary general who accrues power by appointing loyal underlings to positions of influence. These caudillos are a fact of life which we should cultivate, not fight against."
 MEX_focus_support_general_cedillo: "Support General Cedillo"
 MEX_focus_support_general_cedillo_desc: "The Northern General Saturnino Cedillo and other caudillos like him need assurances that their autonomy will be respected by the government. The rapid centralization of power under presidents Calles and Cárdenas has allowed us to bring massive weight to bear on the problems facing the nation, so further dispossession of the caudillos is not needed."
 tooltip_mexico_cedillo_will_be_placated: "General Cedillo will be §Gplacated§!.\n"
 MEX_focus_oil_field_expansion: "Oil Field Expansion"
 MEX_focus_oil_field_expansion_desc: "America's need for oil is insatiable. Even though they produce a majority of oil in the world, they import the resource as well. Mexico has undeveloped oil fields up and down the Gulf Coast which we can tap into for exports."
 MEX_focus_northern_steel_plants: "Northern Steel Plants"
 MEX_focus_northern_steel_plants_desc: "The most industrialized region in Mexico outside the capital is the northern border with America. Cities along the Rio Grande such as Matamoros and Ciudad Juarez enjoy close economic ties to their counterparts over the border like Brownsville and El Paso. We should exploit the superior infrastructure in the area to further develop our heavy industries."
 MEX_focus_capital_reserves: "Capital Reserves"
 MEX_focus_capital_reserves_desc: "The hard cash we raise selling oil is allowing us to flex our economic muscles. If we need to buy technology from America or Britain, for example, we now have the means. We can reverse engineer or mass produce these designs as we see fit."
 MEX_focus_oil_revenue_reinvestment: "Oil Revenue Reinvestment"
 MEX_focus_oil_revenue_reinvestment_desc: "As we now benefit more from the selling of oil, our budget has quickly increased and we must plan on a useful way to use those new funds. In order to benefit from it in the long run, a reinvestment of those revenues into economic stimulation seems to be the most obvious choice."
 MEX_focus_royal_dutch_shell: "Royal Dutch Shell"
 MEX_focus_royal_dutch_shell_desc: "Royal Dutch Shell is a British and Dutch firm holding 60% of Mexican oil concessions. By compromising with the foreign oil companies on the matter of labor disputes, we can come to an accomodation that is beneficial to us both."
 MEX_focus_community_of_nations: "Community of Nations"
 MEX_focus_community_of_nations_desc: "Our economic dependence on British trade need not be a curse. By accepting the status quo we can engage in international diplomacy with the backing of a super power."
 anglo_mexican_diplomacy: "Anglo-Mexican Diplomacy"
 MEX_focus_purchase_belize: "Purchase Belize"
 MEX_focus_purchase_belize_desc: "This small territory was long claimed by the Spanish crown in colonial times, though never settled by peninsulares. After the loss of Spain's colonial empire during the Napoleonic Wars, Britain gradually solidifed a hold on the territory, culminating in the creation of the colony of British Honduras in 1862. The territory ought to be turned over to Mexico as a gesture of good faith."
 MEX_focus_nationalize_the_oil_fields: "Nationalize the Oil Fields"
 MEX_focus_nationalize_the_oil_fields_desc: "The foreign oil concessions are dominating the Mexican economy and exerting too much influence over our affairs, both domestic and foreign. The British and Americans pay more attention to Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil than to our government!"
 tooltip_mexico_they_may_declare_war: "§RThey may be persuaded to declare war by the oil barons!§!\n"
 MEX_focus_german_resource_exchange: "German Resource Exchange"
 MEX_focus_german_resource_exchange_desc: "The German war machine is gearing back up and needs Mexican oil to function properly. Rather than prostrate ourselves before the Americans or sell our country to the Russians, we can try to exploit the German need for oil to improve our military power."
 mexico_german_resource_exchange: "Mexican-German Resource Exchange"
 MEX_focus_new_world_order: "New World Order"
 MEX_focus_new_world_order_desc: "The Germans are clearly the masters of Europe. We will surely have a place in their New World Order if we help them against the British and Americans. The old Zimmermann Telegram was sent for a reason: America can only be destroyed by a land invasion..."
 german_mexican_diplomacy: "German-Mexican Diplomacy"
 MEX_focus_oppose_yanqui_imperialism: "Oppose Yanqui Imperialism"
 MEX_focus_oppose_yanqui_imperialism_desc: "Having rightfully reclaimed the natural resources of our country, the foreigners are now clamoring for compensation, but the concessions were essentially stolen from the Mexican people in their time of weakness under the dictator Díaz. Why should we pay a thief for returning stolen property?"
 MEX_focus_international_proletarianism: "International Proletarianism"
 MEX_focus_international_proletarianism_desc: "The Soviets have demonstrated that their socialism will transform the planet. The Revolution we fought so hard for was only one step on the road to liberating the people: first of Mexico, and now of the entire world."
 russo_mexican_diplomacy: "Russo-Mexican Diplomacy"
 MEX_focus_interior_defence_plan: "Interior Defense Plan"
 MEX_focus_interior_defence_plan_desc: "It's true that the Yanquis have a numerical and technological advantage over us, but we have knowledge of the terrain, support from the people, and time and space to establish a strong defense. We will bleed the enemy in the deserts and mountains using hit-and-run tactics, defense-in-depth, and hidden strongpoints."
 MEX_focus_compensation: "Compensation"
 MEX_focus_compensation_desc: "The oil concessions were legally sold to Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil. We cannot fault the foreign firms for seeking a profit. We should maintain the integrity of our legal system by compensating the foreigners for nationalizing the concessions."
 MEX_focus_liberty_and_justice_for_all: "Liberty and Justice For All"
 MEX_focus_liberty_and_justice_for_all_desc: "The Americans are now the greatest economic power in history. The Soviets may be fast industrializing, and the Germans may understand war better, but America's advantages are complimented by her insistence upon freedom for the individual and reliance on institutions over brute force. Extending our economic ties to a military alliance would only be natural."

 MEX_focus_aztec_eagles: "Aztec Eagles"

 MEX_focus_international_peacekeepers_desc: "The democratic powers of the world plan to create an alliance of equals, a United Nations, to ensure international security by giving the countries of the world a place to reconcile their differences and arbitrate disputes. We will throw ourselves into such a project to help the Latin American nations maintain their independence."
 MEX_focus_march_southwards: "March Southwards"
 MEX_focus_march_southwards_desc: "Mexico lost the provinces to her south after the independence struggle. The incompetent Mexican Empire was a blight on our history, but we can rectify its mistakes. The Southern states are critical to our defense and we will reclaim them."

 MEX_focus_unify_centroamerica: "Unify Centroamérica"

 MEX_focus_seize_the_panama_canal: "Seize the Panamá Canal"
 MEX_focus_seize_the_panama_canal_desc: "One of the most critical chokepoints in the world, this canal was dug at great cost to the Latino workers who bled and died under American whips for the profit of the industrialists. Having captured the surrounding terrain, we can launch a lightning strike on the small canal garrison, forcing the Yanquis to choose between waging a bloody war against us or turning over control of the canal."
 MEX_focus_fortify_the_canal: "Fortify the Canal"
 MEX_focus_fortify_the_canal_desc: "With the Panama Canal finally within our hands, we have to secure its locks and banks so that it will become an impregnable fortress."
 MEX_focus_integrate_the_south: "Integrate the South"
 MEX_focus_integrate_the_south_desc: "The unity of the peoples of Mexico has been a slow process, but it will not stop at regional borders or mountain ranges. We have surmounted such obstacles in the past and we will do so again for the Southern provinces."
 MEX_focus_plan_of_agua_prieta: "Plan of Agua Prieta"
 MEX_focus_plan_of_agua_prieta_desc: "The Revolution against Díaz and the vicious infighting afterwards lasted a decade. When the dust was settled, the victorious Northern generals met at Agua Prieta, Sonora, to lay out their plan for Mexico's future. They are a populist clique of modernizers and secularizers, or else a 'confederation of caciques' little better than bandit lords dividing their spoils, depending upon one's perspective."
 MEX_focus_exile_calles: "Exile Calles"
 MEX_focus_exile_calles_desc: "The former president Plutarco Calles served his term between 1924 and 1928. His misrule incited the Cristero War and countless minor rebellions. Now he seeks to dominate President Cárdenas as he controlled the last few puppet presidents. Cárdenas has his own democratic mandate, his own plan for the future, and Calles needs to leave for the sake of the stability of Mexico."
 MEX_focus_institutional_revolution: "Institutional Revolution"
 MEX_focus_institutional_revolution_desc: "The legacy of democracy is weak in Mexico, but we have strengthened it. Our commitment to the rule of law is progressing and the people are starting to trust our elections, which were manipulated by the government in the past."
 MEX_focus_jefe_maximo: "Jefe Máximo"
 MEX_focus_jefe_maximo_desc: "Mexico will descend even deeper into chaos if Plutarco Calles loses his influence over the country. He created the administrations of Portes, Ortiz, Rodríguez and now Cárdenas, and his political enemies castigate him as 'el Jefe Maximo', like some bandit chieftain! In truth, Calles is simply an elderly statesman with only the best intentions for Mexico in mind. Losing him at this stage of the Revolution would be a travesty."
 MEX_focus_purge_the_bureaucracy: "Purge the Bureaucracy"
 MEX_focus_purge_the_bureaucracy_desc: "The Callistas are being removed from their unearned positions of influence. We have many suitable replacements in mind, men of ability and intelligence who will be grateful for the opportunity to serve Mexico..."
 MEX_focus_arrest_general_cedillo: "Arrest General Cedillo"
 MEX_focus_arrest_general_cedillo_desc: "The caudillos are a menace. They divide Mexico into petty fiefdoms where their appointment of officials gives them power over the economy, military and government. They are looting the wealth of Mexico, and nowhere is this more true than in the province of General Saturnino Cedillo. His independence from the central government is utterly intolerable, and the rebels he is amassing will not avail him."

 MEX_focus_control_the_army: "Control the Army"
 MEX_focus_control_the_army_desc: "The army is perhaps the most important constituency in Mexico. The past twenty years have shown that the will of the people can only be enforced by bayonets. Rogue generals are therefore a threat to the very existence of the state, let alone its legitimacy."
 MEX_focus_repeal_the_calles_law: "Repeal the Calles Law"
 MEX_focus_repeal_the_calles_law_desc: "Calles incited the Cristeros to revolt by heavy-handed application of the anti-religious articles of the Constitution. The Calles Law humiliates the clergy by forbidding the wearing of clerical garb in public and imprisonment for religious figures who criticize the government. We agree that the Church's political influence needs curtailing but these are attacks on individual liberty, not Church power."
 MEX_focus_abolish_capital_punishment: "Abolish Capital Punishment"
 MEX_focus_abolish_capital_punishment_desc: "The recent instabilities of military rebellion, peasant revolt and the Cristero War, and the government's bloody response to these and to pettier 'crimes', have resulted in an atmosphere of fear pervading Mexico. People can no longer talk freely for fear of being tyrannized by the state. We should phase out capital punishment. By loosening our grip, people will no longer feel compelled to escape it."
 MEX_focus_enforce_the_calles_law: "Enforce the Calles Law"
 MEX_focus_enforce_the_calles_law_desc: "The Cristero footsoldiers may not have been destroyed in the field, but in the years following their futile rebellion we hunted down their remaining leaders and sympathizers within the Church, decapitating their movement and ensuring no resurgence. The Church has no choice but to accept our demands against them. They will become another instrument of the state's power or we will continue decapitating them."
 MEX_focus_triumph_over_the_cristeros: "Triumph over the Cristeros"
 MEX_focus_triumph_over_the_cristeros_desc: "Many talented individuals rose to the top during the anti-Cristero campaigns. Fighting insurgents with small unit tactics and aerial support gave our generals an excellent opportunity to test their abilities. The repression campaign also let us see who had the stomach for messier work."
 MEX_focus_state_education: "State Education"
 MEX_focus_state_education_desc: "Socialist education in Mexico means a focus on rationalism and patriotism, rather than adherence to the Pope's dogmas and diktats. We only need to give one generation of Mexican youths a good anti-Church education and their popular support will vanish overnight. People will not tolerate the parasitic clergy when they know that a different world is possible."
 MEX_focus_xefo: "XEFO"
 MEX_focus_xefo_desc: "The government has been building radio masts and setting up stations all over the country. It is useful for disseminating propaganda but it also brings rural people into closer contact with one another. XEFO is one such radio station that is run by the Partido Nacional Revolucionario."
 MEX_focus_law_on_industrial_promotion: "Law on Industrial Promotion"
 MEX_focus_law_on_industrial_promotion_desc: "For many years, the Mexican states and federal government have sought to encourage development of new industries via tax exemptions. Oftentimes, the local regulations work against national interests by diverting capital to unimportant or inefficient areas. We need to rationalize our approach to industrial development with a centralized plan."
 MEX_focus_nafinsa: "NAFINSA"
 MEX_focus_nafinsa_desc: "Nacional Financiera is a development bank established to encourage the industrialization of Mexico. It has been especially important in the creation of new factories in the central Mexican states, such as chemical plants and metalworks in Mexico City."

 MEX_focus_television_innovators: "Television Innovators"
 MEX_focus_television_innovators_desc: "Mexico has a surprisingly advanced electronics industry. Guillermo González Camarena and other members of the 'League of Radio Experiments' are experimenting with color television transmissions. We could become world leaders in communications technology if we focus on these developments."
 MEX_focus_antidisestablishmentarianism: "Antidisestablishmentarianism"
 MEX_focus_antidisestablishmentarianism_desc: "The True Faith has been abused by the 'Revolutionary' junta for decades now. Churches, monasteries and reliquaries are formally owned by the state, with clergymen requiring licenses from the government to tend to their flocks. Some states have a single priest for tens of thousands of faithful. Let us drop this requirement and allow the Church to own property once again."
 MEX_focus_rewrite_the_constitution: "Rewrite the Constitution of 1917"
 MEX_focus_rewrite_the_constitution_desc: "The Constitution written by the vicious generals places the state above the Church, making marriage a civil act, preventing the clergy from endorsing political candidates, and refusing to recognise the Catholic Church as the source of moral authority in Mexico. We must address these inconsistencies by formally establishing the Catholic Faith as the state religion."
 MEX_focus_legion_of_christ: "Legion of Christ"
 MEX_focus_legion_of_christ_desc: "We are righting the wrongs of the 'Revolution' with the indefatigable spirit befitting agents of Christ, but we have only just begun. We need an organization to seek out and punish the criminals who attacked the Holy Church. As it says in the Book of Exodus: take eye for eye, life for life."
 MEX_focus_crusade_against_atheism: "Crusade Against Atheism"
 MEX_focus_crusade_against_atheism_desc: "Most of the Cristero leaders were hunted down and murdered by the government in the early 1930s. A few escaped the purges, however, and are ready to lead the Faithful of Mexico once again. Long live Christ the King and Blessed Mary of Guadalupe!"
 MEX_focus_knights_of_columbus: "Knights of Columbus"
 MEX_focus_knights_of_columbus_desc: "During the Cristero War, when abuses were being committed on both sides, the international fraternity of the Knights of Columbus intervened to assist us. Initially they covertly raised donations to fund and arm the Cristeros. After the Mexican bishops disavowed the rebellion, the Knights lobbied the American government to host negotiations which ultimately ended the war."
 MEX_focus_catholic_politics: "Catholic Politics"
 MEX_focus_catholic_politics_desc: "Most political parties in Mexico have been dominated by the anticlericals who gained power after the revolution of 1911. If we, the Catholics, want to take and keep power legally, the creation of a party of the pious Masses will be necessary."
 MEX_focus_social_catholicism: "Social Catholicism"
 MEX_focus_social_catholicism_desc: "A doctrine of political religion dating from the early 1900s, Social Catholicism places emphasis on relieving the burdens of the poor by attacking the causes of poverty. The injustices caused by unfettered industrial capitalism need a coherent response from the Church, and the progressive clergy of Mexico will do their best to resolve it."
 MEX_focus_church_schools: "Church Schools"
 MEX_focus_church_schools_desc: "The Revolutionary generals sought to brainwash the youth in socialist re-education camps they called schools. We must place religion in the classroom once again, with priests and nuns educating our children."
 MEX_focus_triumph_of_synarchism: "Triumph of Synarchism"
 MEX_focus_triumph_of_synarchism_desc: "Utterly beaten, our enemies are hiding in the shadows like the henchmen of Satan. We now have free hands to ensure the reconstruction of the state in a way that will ensure its unity both in faith and in political will."
 MEX_focus_reform_the_cristero_guard: "Reform the Cristero Guard"
 MEX_focus_reform_the_cristero_guard_desc: "The Cristeros valiantly defended the Church from the oppression of Calles the tyrant and a lot of them died as martyrs under the banner of Christ. Now that the power of the Holy Church has been restored, they must be reorganized in order to become the armed protectors of Christ."

 MEX_focus_synarchist_communes: "Synarchist Communes"
 MEX_focus_synarchist_communes_desc: "Now that the minds of the people have been saved from the 'Revolutionaries' and the faithful are flocking back to the reconsecrated churches, our economic plan can be implemented. New units of production will allow the faithful to serve the national cause and the Church while experiencing a sense of unity in faith and mind alike."
 MEX_focus_revolutionary_women: "Revolutionary Women"
 MEX_focus_revolutionary_women_desc: "Traditionally associated with domestic work, women have also performed industrial labor for decades in Mexico. The tobacco, coffee and clothing industries tend to hire a majority of women, although this has caused friction with the male-dominated trades union movement. Men already have a right to equal pay for equal work and a minimum wage - we should enforce this right for women, as well."
 MEX_focus_womens_suffrage: "Women's Suffrage"
 MEX_focus_womens_suffrage_desc: "Many legislators and cabinet ministers of the Revolutionary governments opposed the extension of the right to vote for women because they believed women would be more easily swayed by the arguments of the clergy and would end the program of secularization. Whatever the case in the past, we cannot stand in the path of progress."
 MEX_focus_soldaderas: "Soldaderas"
 MEX_focus_soldaderas_desc: "An iconic part of the Revolution, women soldiers fought in the rank and file and some were promoted to junior officer positions. They were especially important for the logistics of the poorly provisioned Revolutionary armies."
 MEX_focus_ban_political_militias: "Ban Political Militias"
 MEX_focus_ban_political_militias_desc: "The left- and right-wing paramilitaries claim to be patriots fighting national traitors, but in truth they are pawns of foreign powers who seek to destabilize the country for nefarious ends. The government must clamp down on the fascist and communist militias."
 MEX_focus_depoliticised_army: "Depoliticized Army"
 MEX_focus_depoliticised_army_desc: "The generals have no right to the allegience of their soldiers. The ultimate source of legitimacy is the Mexican state. We should prevent the generals entertaining any thoughts of rebellion by rotating them between provinces so that they cannot build up patronage networks or secure the personal loyalty of their soldiers."
 MEX_focus_professional_army: "Escuela Superior de Guerra"
 MEX_focus_professional_army_desc: "We cannot rely on ad hoc soldaderas to provision the troops in the field, we need supply depots and a logistics corps. In the Military School our army chiefs and officers will acquire advanced military knowledge that will enable them to develop efficient supply systems. \nAt this point, even donkeys would be an improvement over leaving the troops to forage supplies for themselves."
 MEX_focus_legacy_of_revolution: "Legacy of Revolution"
 MEX_focus_legacy_of_revolution_desc: "The gains of the Revolution must be defended and national traitors rooted out. The generals are at the forefront of this struggle. They see the difficulties the government faces every day on the ground. We should give them more discretion in enforcing the rule of the state."
 MEX_focus_the_gold_shirts: "The Gold Shirts"
 MEX_focus_the_gold_shirts_desc: "General Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco formed the Gold Shirts in 1933 to defeat communist traitors working against the government. The paramiliatary group should become a wing of the government as their goal is admirable and their methods necessary."
 MEX_focus_revanchist_revolution: "Revanchist Revolution"
 MEX_focus_revanchist_revolution_desc: "The Mexican people were long abused by Yanqui aggression and communist infiltration, but we have overcome these obstacles to national unity and forged a strong state with a powerful leader. We must now undo the wrongs Mexico suffered in the past."

 MEX_focus_the_red_shirts: "The Red Shirts"
 MEX_focus_the_red_shirts_desc: "Governor Tomás Garrido Canabal created the Red Shirts in 1930 to defend the Revolution against the Catholic Church and its reactionary priests. Seeking out and destroying enemies of the people is a worthy cause, so we should bring the Red Shirts into the military in some capacity."
 MEX_focus_communist_revolution: "Communist Revolution"

 MEX_focus_hispanic_alliance_desc: "Our rulers are descended from the peninsulares, colonists who brought civilization to the New World. Spain, with her strong tradition of Church power and landed elites, was once a source of legitimacy. Nowadays, Spain looks less and less like the leader of the Latin world.

 MEX_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser M02"
 MEX_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1902 is one of several Mauser rifles in service with the Mexican military, but is currently by far the most common. Chambered in 7x57mm, the Model 1902 is a highly modified Spanish Model 1893 Mauser integrating several parts and design elements from the later Mauser Model 1898. The Model 1902, which was purchased in large quantities from the German company DWM, is nearly identical to the domestically produced Model 1910."

 MEX_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mondragón M29"
 MEX_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The revolutionary Mondragón Model 1908 was among the first semi-automatic rifles to see combat, even serving with the German Luftstreitkräfte during the Weltkrieg. While effective, the Mondragón has always suffered reliability issues and is expensive to produce. The Model 1929 is a modernised and easier to manufacture version of the original Mondragón."
