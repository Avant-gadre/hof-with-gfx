 CZE_fortification_studies: "Fortification Studies"
 CZE_fortification_studies_desc: "The need to fortify our border is clear, but the question is how? The French have recently constructed an incredible fortified line of their own, the Maginot Line, and by sending a delegation to study their methods it should be possible to solve our own border defense problems."
