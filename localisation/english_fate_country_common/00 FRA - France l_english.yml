 lr_france.27.d: "After our unprecedented concession, the arrogant "Roman" refused. It seems that it was a mistake from the beginning."
 lr_france.27.a: "We will parade at Rome."

 lr_france.28.t: "Unexpected Result"
 lr_france.28.d: "The meeting between Queen Marie and Jeanne drew a disaster! The famous murderer and arsonist "Black Virgin" arrived first and almost caused the Queen to be unpredictable, while Kingdom General Gille de Raiss seemed to be "another Joan of Arc" in the court, after the Black Saint's terrorist attack on the Palace of Versailles failed. He declared, "Let us raise the banner of salvation again under the guidance of the Black Virgin!" He led his department to openly rebel in Orleans, and a large number of soldiers who were extremely dissatisfied with the restoration of the Kingdom have already invested this rebel and his black Virgin. . However, from the past words and deeds of the "Black Virgin", she was just a demented lunatic who wanted to "burn France". The brutal collective execution and scorched earth policy in the rebellious area quickly woke up the blindly followed soldiers, and the Kingdom's military has After the assembly is complete and declare war on the rebels, how far can she and the mad marshal's path of destruction go?"
 lr_france.28.a: "Ma colère ne finit jamais!"
 lr_france.29.t: "Seek Support?"
 lr_france.29.d: "On this issue, the Black Virgin and Gille de Raiss rarely had a disagreement. She bluntly said that she did not like Gille de Raiss's friend, and also the Italian artist Francesca Prelati who has been secretly funding terrorist activities. "Gille! The Germans have tanks! Do you know ?! This is not the time when you killed a few children in the castle to summon demons!" And Gille de Raiss, known for his tyranny, treated her With rare patience, "I understand, but the virgin, no matter how the times change, the devil is still in everyone's heart, and the thing we have to do is to awaken the devil in people's hearts instead of simple killing.""
 lr_france.29.a: ""That's you, I just want to fight the Hundred Years' War, that's all."" 
 lr_france.29.b: ""Maybe the hundred years of war are over ...""
 lr_france.30.t: "The French insurgents sought support from us?!"
 lr_france.30.d: "It is very strange that the Black Virgin, who has recently caused a chaos in France, even asked us for reinforcements. According to her request, we should send "large size" troops to wear French uniforms and go directly to the French territory to fight, and the reward she promised is to join our camp after winning, then ..."
 lr_france.30.a: "We will send out "volunteers""
 lr_france.30.b: "Where did this psychopath come from?"
 lr_france.31.t: "German volunteers comes!"
 lr_france.31.d: "They agreed! The German army has disguised itself across the border to accept our command!"
 lr_france.31.a: "Let's revenge together!"
 lr_france.32.t: "Germany refused"
 lr_france.32.d: ""Uh, Jeanne, I really didn't lie to you, it's not that we have friends who share a common enemy.""
 lr_france.32.a: ""OK, what about your old friend then?""
 lr_france.33.t: ""Oh, isn't this Gille and the Virgin?""
 lr_france.33.d: ""Uh, Plerati, my friend! You really are ready," "Ah? After all, it seems that the Vrigin doesn't like me very much, so I'll wait for you to make a statement before showing up. So This is the gift I gave you, but I sold my all belongings for these arms. ""
 lr_france.33.a: ""Why didn't you sell yourself?""
 lr_france.34.t: "Black Virgin seeks help from us"
 lr_france.34.d: "The current French regime does implement their unique reverse nationalist theory, and naturally the legitimacy of their regime tends to zero indefinitely. And the police force we sent in the past was simply not enough. The large number of guerrilla warfare in the countryside even caused many police officers used to law enforcement in Germany to suffer "heavy casualties". For this reason, the Black Virgin proposed that we send a real big figure, so who should be sent? It seems that she appreciates the imperial security bureau chief's methods."
 lr_france.34.a: "Then send Heydrich." 
 lr_france.34.b: "Send his assistant"
 lr_france.35.t: "Here comes Heydrich"
 lr_france.35.d: "Reinhard Heidrich saw a ruin and a woman in black when she got off the plane. There is no doubt that it was the Black Virgin who came in to become a topic in the political circle of Berlin. In fact, it is still the ruins of the former Champs Elysées. It seems that she is playing a real game."
 lr_france.35.a: "The two shook hands enthusiastically." 
 lr_france.36.t: "Here comes Heydrich.....'s assistant"
 lr_france.36.d: "When Ernst Kaltenbrunner got off the plane, he saw a ruin and a woman in black. There is no doubt that it was the Black Virgin who was repeatedly mentioned by Mr. Heidrich recently, and this "airport "It's actually the ruins of the former Champs Elysées, which is really a bit confusing."
 lr_france.36.a: "The two shook hands." 

 lr_france.37.t: "Consolidate Domination"
 lr_france.37.d: "In fact, our rule is limited to the area around Orleans. Almost every "French" is resisting our "daily behavior." Naturally, this is not surprising. After all, we are here to destroy them. However, there is no resistance in the castle of Tiffauges. After the renovation, the castle has been used as the headquarters of the National Secret Police. According to legend, Gilles de Rais has always used this as a base to carry out torture of children... Naturally, there will be no such "fun" and meaningless things now, but no matter whether they are opponents or potential opponents, they will step into the castle one by one. Gilderas seems to have invested greater enthusiasm than the military command in this regard."
 lr_france.37.a: "Every castle will have this feature." 
 lr_france.38.t: "New Culture Movement"
 lr_france.38.d: "It's time to destroy consumer culture! It should be back to the time of the damn Valois dynasty when everyone is favor of fighting! Of course, we have no reason to drive the "French" to fight for us, but what about that? It 's time to prepare for the premiere of Joan of Arc, directed by Antonin Artaud and Francisca Plerati, we will use a gun or a burning flask to keep everything in the house The poor worms in the movie get out and watch the movie! Maybe this will subvert their worldview ... All we demand is this effect!"
 lr_france.38.a: ""Prepare that, Gilles""  
 lr_france.39.t: "Successful Premiere"
 lr_france.39.d: "The premiere on the ruins of Orleans City Hall is perfect! very successful! Although no one applauded ... this was not the case after the black saint who was hidden in the audience randomly burned to death, everyone began to applaud, for this almost unknown shit movie, "The plot that Jeanne d'Arc killed everyone in Hundred Years War is just bullshit..."One person finally couldn't help but stop applauding, and then he was taken away by the secret police and tied to the torture rack."
 lr_france.39.a: ""It was so good! Why are there complaints?!""   
 lr_france.40.t: "In the Shadow"
 lr_france.40.d: ""Never let this lunatic continue to run rampant!" "Must kill her!" "And the Italian guy!!! It was the bastard who led the so-called renovation of Notre Dame!" A few in the basement of a Parisian cafe The French indignantly poured out their hatred of the current powers. For this reason, they let go of everything in the past. Both the socialists towards Moscow and the royalist party that led the retro movement were united, but the meeting was evolving into outrage."
 lr_france.40.a: ""Kill that Lunatic!""  
 lr_france.40.b: ""No more words, action tommorrow!""  
 lr_france.41.t: "Successful Raid"
 lr_france.41.d: "There have been several "secret rallies" that have been destroyed by Francisca-led remediation operations recently, erm ... Although most of them are just civilians venting their dissatisfaction, this is still unforgivable! The new order of the Black Virgin is perfect and cannot be questioned by anyone, and now these people will all be put on fire and burned to death."
 lr_france.41.a: ""I started to change my mind towards that bitch!!""  
 lr_france.42.t: "Action Preparation"
 lr_france.42.d: "Finally, after not knowing how many quarrels, the participants finally decided to rush into Orleans! Kill the crazy woman! But what about weapons? The bloodthirsty lunatics under the mad women showed their unique high efficiency, and almost all the arms in France were taken away."
 lr_france.42.a: ""I used to be an arms dealer!""   
 lr_france.43.t: "Before the Action"
 lr_france.43.d: ""I was thinking in the past, when she was just a rural bandit, thinking about why she destroyed France so persistently, or who is she?" "Is this important?" The arms dealer who is distributing weapons as if he had become the leader of this squad, he seemed uninterested in the speech of the young man. "Of course it is important, sir, do you know where she came from?""
 lr_france.43.a: ""It's true that I really don't know, who of you know?""
 lr_france.44.t: "Sudden big discussion"
 lr_france.44.d: "What exactly is the Black Virgin? No one seemed to be able to answer this question. She was like a whirlwind sweeping around the area of Orleans, gathering a group of potential death row criminals to kill and set fire. There are many slogans, and the content is nothing more than "burning France", so she should be a guy with a deep hatred against France. Is she Jeanne's reincarnation? But isn't the real Jeanne there? So, some kind of "Homunculus" did the Germans make to destroy us?"
 lr_france.44.a: ""Fuck it! Don't think about killing her tomorrow!"" 
 lr_france.45.t: "The assassination plot was foiled"
 lr_france.45.d: "There have been several "secret rallies" that have been destroyed by Francesca-led remediation operations. Although most of them are just civilians who are venting their dissatisfaction, there are special ones! The secret police found armed people gathered during a routine inspection of a coffee shop in Paris. After the fierce exchange of fire, we paid a lot of casualties to wipe them out, but unfortunately these people did not have to go to the fire."
 lr_france.45.a: ""I started to change my mind towards that bitch!!""  
 lr_france.46.t: "Proclaim our new order"
 lr_france.46.d: "Almost all organized resistance movements have been destroyed under our series of iron fist policies. Marshal Gilles de Rais and Francesca even complained that the castles in the entire territory are not enough. Now that the French either start to support us or have despaired about reality and can only support us, then it is time to start a real career! First of all, we will stand in the world with a new name!"
 lr_france.46.a: "Royal director Artaud suggested keeping the name of France and calling it the pioneer."  
 lr_france.46.b: "The Black Virgin insisted on erasing France, in the name of the dragon."  
 lr_france.47.t: "Question"
 lr_france.47.d: ""By the way, Jill, did you really check the origin of the Black Virgin?" Francisca rarely asked questions about things, and this question is definitely going to come. Sure enough, the mad marshal stopped the gratuitous dance, closed the book and thoughtfully stayed for a long time. "I really don't know where she came from. When I met her she was like this now, in the countryside of Orleans ... I honestly never thought about where she came from? Anyway you and I The ideal is gradually being realized ... or ... Plerati, why don't you ask why we are in this era? ""
 lr_france.47.a: ""Ahaha! I'm over worried."" 
 lr_france.48.t: "Find Collaborator"
 lr_france.48.d: "At the suggestion of the German consultant, Lord Black Virgin took the means of enveloping the French, and soon some activists stood out among the collaborators. Far-rightist Jacques Doriot, an ex-communist and Pierre Raval, a politician known for flattering Germany before the Kingdom is retored, was their representative. The two men were appointed Ministers of the Interior and Prime Minister after sworn allegiance to the Black Virgin and the highest German leader far from Berlin."
 lr_france.48.a: ""Work hard, or die.""
 lr_france.49.t: "Back to time before the restoration?"
 lr_france.49.d: "Dorio and Raval quickly summoned a large number of politicians from the time of the original French Republic. Their composition is still quite messy. There are right-wingers and left-wingers in the past. This is not important to us. Anyway, It is enough for them to be willing to "rebuild the country" under the eyes of the Black Virgin and the Germans."
 lr_france.49.a: ""They are professional in this respect.""
 lr_france.50.t: "Drafting a new constitution?"
 lr_france.50.d: "Gradually, we are now more and more like a "France", it seems that this is a little against the original intention of the Black Lady, France has not been destroyed ... how could it be? Wouldn't it be more fun to let them under German rule than to destroy them? So now Laval presents a document, he hopes to establish a dictatorship that upholds the three principles of "working family, motherland", then the name of the country will be changed to a relatively formal "France", this maybe..."
 lr_france.50.a: ""It doesn't matter, you could remain a name.""
 lr_france.50.b: ""France? Do you dare to mention it?"" 
 lr_france.51.t: "A self-defeat..."
 lr_france.51.d: "The first motorized division of the "French Thuleschutztruppe" led by Jacques Doriot has been completed. Today this force will be inspected by the Cabinet in Orleans, only when Prime Minister Laval is speaking to the soldiers on behalf of the Cabinet. In an accident, a soldier raised the Mauser rifle in his hand and turned the trigger against him. Until now, Laval, who was sent to Germany for first aid, was out of danger, and the perpetrators were executed by the Black Lady on the spot. Afterwards, Doriot was forced to conduct a political review of all soldiers and stopped all training programs."
 lr_france.51.a: ""It's a real waste.""
 lr_france.52.t: "German worker attacked"
 lr_france.52.d: "Recently, there have been many vicious incidents around the German workers 'camps in my country. Many workers in the camps were attacked in urban areas and in the wild after get off work. There were dozens of serious incidents that caused deaths. Maybe we should continue to introduce security forces from Germany, otherwise we cannot maintain the stability of the entire French land with our troops loyal to us, and cooperation with Germany is impossible to talk about then."
 lr_france.52.a: ""Request some polices from them?""  
 lr_france.53.t: "Investigation report sent to Himmler"
 lr_france.53.d: "... It seems that as you thought, the brainwashing of the two Joan of Arc clones in the early years can be said to be a complete failure, and the defective product that never grew up lost all its memories. This one who works with us is also based on his inner thoughts rather than psychological hints. In short, it is not a bad thing to continue such cooperation. Although her country is not completely controlled by us, there is no reason to oppose us. I personally recommend that you do not instruct Old Man Einzberen to clone foreign dignitaries. Regarding the current situation as if it could be reproduced at will. Oh, and be careful not to let Miss Alice touch the core of the experiment, and remember to close the cultivation tank. ———— Your loyal Rhinehard Heidrich"
 lr_france.53.a: ""Let this secret die forever""  
 lr_france.54.t: "Loyal French Thuleschutztruppe"
 lr_france.54.d: "After the last vicious incident, Dorio once again formed the second armoured grenadier division of the "French Thuleschutztruppe". This time, after carefully selecting the political qualities of the soldiers, no one finally shot at the rostrum. Then, the soldiers held their heads up and their morale was uplifted, ready to fight side by side with the German allies under the command of the Black Virgin."
 lr_france.54.a: ""It finally looks a bit correct."" 
 lr_france.55.t: "Liberate Colonies"
 lr_france.55.d: "We had no interest in the colonies, and the colonial government did not take a stand in the Civil War. It's time to direct rule from Orleans."
 lr_france.55.a: ""Demand them to obey""  
 lr_france.56.t: "Demands from Orlean"
 lr_france.56.d: "Orleans ordered us to dissolve government institutions and obey them completely, which may not be a good idea. The colonies are now packed with politicians and generals of the former kingdom, who are not going to do so."
 lr_france.56.a: ""Seek help from King of Britain""   
 lr_france.56.b: ""We have no other choices""   
 lr_france.57.t: "Call from French colonies"
 lr_france.57.d: "France, which was in power, seemed to be trying to consolidate its rule over the colonies recently, while the ousted royal government had shown us a willingness to form an "British-French United Kingdom" that would now leave the colonies of West Africa and the Indo-Chinese peninsula to us, and that in the future we would be able to begin the domination across the Straits if we defeated the demons of Orleans."
 lr_france.57.a: "At least we are in agreement against lunatics."   
 lr_france.57.b: "We are not going to provoke..."    
 lr_france.58.t: "They refused"
 lr_france.58.d: "We have no choices"
 lr_france.58.a: "This is our destiny"   
 lr_france.59.t: "Arrest Prelati"
 lr_france.59.d: "We cannot tolerate this madwoman continuing to make deceptive speeches on our land! For national security and the safety of all mankind, this lunatic must stay in prison!"
 lr_france.59.a: "Successful arrest"   
 lr_france.60.t: "Prelati committed suicide"
 lr_france.60.d: "Perhaps some human rights people will be slightly dissatisfied. Prelati, who was arrested and imprisoned a week ago, died suddenly. Forensic investigation revealed that she left a lot of strange symbols in the cell and pierced the carotid artery with a sharpened spoon. At present, this matter has been spread."
 lr_france.60.a: "It's okay if this guy is dead."  

 lr_france.61.t: "Be careful about French lunatic"
 lr_france.61.d: "Crazy French are deploying troops on our borders, we must beware of them!"
 lr_france.61.a: "Understood."   

 lr_france.62.t: "Statutory Arson Day"
 lr_france.62.d: ""Burn! Burn! Burn!! Burn it for me at this time of the year!" After the order was issued, this day of the year was an "arson day". Every resident under our rule had to light his own house. Must be so. So after encountering some resistance, the Black Virgin personally put the first fire on Notre Dame de Paris. The blue beard and Plerati's men followed up, and soon the entire France was shrouded in flames."
 lr_france.62.a: "Burn and change a name"  
 lr_france.63.t: "Germans have run!"
 lr_france.63.d: ""Jeanne d'Arc, I don't know why you are doing this. The Germans have taken control of all aspects of us. You are all done with this.""

Everything has caused the current [FIC.GetName] to be problematic. It is obvious that the position of Governor can no longer suit him. We need a new governor who can serve."

 ##Infantry Equip

 FRA_infantry_equipment_0: "Fusil Lebel Modèle 1886 M93"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Lebel Mle M93"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Lebel is an 8mm bolt action rifle that has entered French military service since 1887. The world's first firearm to utilise smokeless powder, the rifle is known for its durability and long range. The primary weapon of the French soldier in the trenches of the Weltkrieg; large quantities of the rifle still exist even now under the new regime of the Commune."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1: "MAS Modèle 1936"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "MAS-36"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The proximity of France to the destested German Empire has hastened the call for a more modern bolt action rifle. The new MAS 36 rifle has been chosen by the Commune as the new bolt-action rifle for the revolution. A short 'carbine' style rifle that features dirt resistance and is relatively cheap to produce; the MAS 36 shall serve as the new standard arm to defend France from all her enemies."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2: "MAS Modèle 1938"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "MAS-38"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Following the end of the Weltkrieg, a small arms development programme took place in the Service Technique de l'Armement. With the help of MAS (the weapon's industry, the MAS 38 would be France's first submachine gun. An extremely high quality weapon, the MAS 38 features a fire rate of 650 rounds per minute although its appearance is rather odd given its unorthodox layout."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_3: "MAS Modèle 1940/42"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "MAS-40/42"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The MAS-40/42 is the latest in a series of Communard semi-automatic rifles. Unlike its predecessors, however, the MAS-40/42 was found to be exceptionally reliable in French military testing. The original five round internal magazine, however, was deemed insufficient and a new variant of the MAS-40/42, the 40/42, was developed featuring a detachable ten round box magazine."
 FRA_support_weapons: "FM Chauchat & Brandt Mle 27/31"
 FRA_support_weapons_desc: "Tried and tested in the trenches of the Weltkrieg, the Chauchat has long been hated by the French infantryman. However, despite the hatred for this weapon, when it is not jammed with dirt and mud, the gun is quite reliable to control, and the Chauchat can be fired from the hip as well. The Brandt mortar is a relic from the Weltkrieg, a refinement of the British 'Stokes' trench mortar. A simple and effective weapon, the mortar can be dissembled into three parts and requires a crew of ten."
 FRA_support_weapons2: "Hotchkiss M1922 & Brandt Mle 27/31"
 FRA_support_weapons2_desc: "A sturdy and reliable weapon, the Hotchkiss M1922 is a light machine gun developed by Hotchkiss. Capable of firing 450 rounds per minute, the gun has a regulator that can adjust the rate of fire. The Hotchkiss can be fed from an overhead magazine or 15/24/30 round feed strips."
 FRA_support_weapons3: "Chatelleraut FM Mle 24/29 & Brandt Mle 35/38"
 FRA_support_weapons3_desc: "It is clear to the command of the Commune that the Chauchat and Hotchkiss are seriously outdated. Our designers have come up with a much lighter gun in preparation for the coming war than the Hotchkiss. While the Chatelleraut features a low fire rate, it is a robust and reliable weapon; well-liked by our troops for its consistency and weight. The Brandt Mle 35 is a 60mm mortar to be used by infantry companies for indirect fire. Simple and effective, it only requires a crew of five to operate."
 FRA_support_weapons4: "MAS AA-42 & Brandt Mle 1942"
 FRA_support_weapons4_desc: "Experience in the Second Weltkrieg has led to an interest in general purpose machine guns to serve a variety of tactical roles. With nearly double the rate of fire of the Chatelleraut, the AA-42 is a belt-fed monster that will mow down anything in its path. The Mle 42 is a considerable improvement over its predecessor, with an emphasis on a greater close quarters support weapon."
 FRA_infantry_at: "Canon de 75mm mle 1897 modifee 1933"
 FRA_infantry_at_desc: "The beloved French 75mm is a field gun developed for anti personal usage. While maintaing the shield and wheels of the original field gun, this variant has increased elevation and a 58 degree traverse."
 FRA_infantry_at2: "LRAC de 73mm Mle 1943"
 FRA_infantry_at2_desc: "An anti-tank rocket launcher, the LRAC can fire a 73mm high explosive antitank projectile capable of penetrating over 11 inches of rolled homogenous armour. The fear of every German tank crew, the LRAC has a shield to protect the operator from the rocket's back blast."
 FRA_infantry_weapons2: "RSC 1938 Carbine"
 FRA_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The RSC (Fusil Automatique Modele) is a semi-automatic rifle. While earlier varients were long and limited mobility, the carbine version allows for greater movement on the battlefield. This 1938 version features numerous changes to its predecessors such as simpler production, takedown, and cleaning of the rifle."
 FRA_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "MAS-36 LG39"
 FRA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "This variant of the MAS-36 comes equipped with a folding hollow aluminium stock and strengthened barrel. It can also be used for grenade launching purposes as it comes with a 48mm grenade launcher."
 FRA_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "CEAM Modele 1944"
 FRA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "A secret design copied from the German line of assualt rifles, the CEAM Modele 1944 is France's first assualt rifle. Chambered in 0.30 carbine rounds, the rifle even comes with a bipod and a folding buttstock."

 FRA_train_equipment_1_desc: "A locomotive with a low axle load, the class could operate not only on the former L'État and the L'Ouest railways, but across the entirety of France. Being simple to operate and reliable, the class would be mass produced after the French Civil War by the SNCF, with the 'B' and 'C' denoting different boiler pressures and the output power."
