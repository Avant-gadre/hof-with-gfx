 ITA_moschettieri_del_duce_desc: "The Duce has, for his own protection, a unit of elite marksmen under his command. While the Duce's safety is, of course, of the highest priority, these exemplary soldiers could also be used to train our regular forces better, improving their effectiveness on the field."
 ITA_a_bandits_war: "A Bandit's War"
 ITA_a_bandits_war_desc: "The old ways of waging war should have died in the trenches on the Isonzo. Some of our old generals still believe that modern war can be won by throwing masses of soldiers into the meatgrinder. We know better now: modern war is won by fast maneuvers and flexible organizations that can react quickly. We must prepare our army for this kind of war."
 ITA_carica_di_isbuscenskij: "Carica di Isbuscenskij"
 ITA_carica_di_isbuscenskij_desc: "Some say that the days of the horse and the rider on the battlefield are over. That the role of cavalry has been taken over by tanks and airplanes. But they are wrong - a horse does not need fuel, it does not need a groundcrew, it requires no spare parts except a new horseshoe every now and then. This gives cavalry a clear advantage even on the modern battlefield."
 ITA_army_leaders: "Army Leaders"
 ITA_army_leaders_desc: "Our armies must always be led by the most capable officers available. It is imperative that we create a steady flow of new and competent officers to maintain the advantage."
 ITA_superesercito: "Superesercito"
 ITA_superesercito_desc: "Coordinating a large army is not an easy undertaking. We need to create a structure for a supreme command, which can guide and support the forces in the field."
 ITA_italian_tankettes: "Italian Tankettes"
 ITA_italian_tankettes_desc: "While other countries might develop ever larger and ever heavier tanks in search of the super-tank that will render all other tanks obsolete, we know that the best tank is a tank that is actually on the field. A tank must be fast enough to go wherever it is needed in time, and it really only needs armor heavy enough to withstand rifles. Such a vehicle would be cheap and quick to produce."
 ITA_bersaglieri: "Bersaglieri"
 ITA_bersaglieri_desc: "The Bersaglieri, our elite light infantry, have long distinguished themselves in battle. While the future of warfare may be mechanized, the quality of the individual soldier will still be the decisive factor."
 ITA_divisioni_alpine: "Divisioni Alpine"
 ITA_divisioni_alpine_desc: "Our memory of the Great War will forever include the brutal fighting in the high alps. If we ever have to defend our country against a foreign invasion again, it will certainly come from the north, and require more fighting in inhospitable mountains. We must have soldiers capable of fighting effectively in that terrain."
 ITA_fanti_dell_aria: "Fanti dell'Aria"
 ITA_fanti_dell_aria_desc: "The bloody stalemate of the Isonzo Front during the Great War forced us into frontal assaults against a well-prepared enemy. The only way to accomplish a breakthrough was by crossing no-mans-land and taking the enemy trench. Modern planes can carry a group of soldiers quickly, far into the enemy's rear areas. Landing by parachute they can take strategic objectives to destabilize the enemy front-line."
 ITA_self_propelled_guns: "Self-Propelled Guns"
 ITA_self_propelled_guns_desc: "The tank may have revolutionized warfare, but in many ways the self-propelled gun the is the most valuable vehicle on the battlefield. The fire support offered by comparatively cheap and simple vehicles is invaluable when it comes to fighting through fortifications or against enemy tanks."
 ITA_end_fiat_ansaldo_duopoly: "End Fiat-Ansaldo Duopoly"
 ITA_end_fiat_ansaldo_duopoly_desc: "Our mechanical and motorized engineering sector has long been dominated by two companies: Fiat and Ansaldo. While these two companies are absolutely world-class engineering firms, it has somewhat stiffled growth as no competitors can survive in the market. We will have to break this duopoly if we want to have a healthy engineering sector in the long term."
 ITA_modernize_ansaldo_facilities: "Modernize Ansaldo Facilities"
 ITA_modernize_ansaldo_facilities_desc: "The economic downturn following the Great War plunged Ansaldo into such financial difficulties that they have largely been unable to properly modernize their factories. Only their elevated status has saved them from bankruptcy. If we wish for Ansaldo to remain such a core part of our mechanical engineering sector, we must ensure that they are using modern machines and techniques."
 ITA_ferrea_mole_ferreo_cuore: "Ferrea Mole Ferreo Cuore"
 ITA_ferrea_mole_ferreo_cuore_desc: "Our tank corps will undoubtedly be called upon to do great deeds of military daring. For this, it will not be enough to merely be driving around hulls of iron, they must also have Hearts of Iron."
 ITA_air_innovations_bba: "Air Innovations"
 ITA_air_innovations_bba_desc: "The war in the air has become one of the decisive fields of modern warfare. We can not allow ourselves to fall behind in this crucial area."
 ITA_citta_dell_aria: "Città dell'Aria"
 ITA_citta_dell_aria_desc: "Our research efforts have long been spread across many different areas around the country. This has made things quite inefficient. We should combine our research efforts and found a 'Sky City', in which scientists and engineers from many different fields of study can work together to build new generations of planes."
 ITA_expand_rome_flying_school: "Expand Rome Flying School"
 ITA_expand_rome_flying_school_desc: "With the growing complexity of modern planes comes an increased risk of accidents if pilots are insufficiently trained. We must ensure that our flying schools keep pace with technical developments in terms of training quality as well as keeping pace with the demand of new pilots caused by growing our military."
 ITA_reggianes_exports: "Reggiane's Exports"
 ITA_reggianes_exports_desc: "The Reggiane company has developed a series of quite capable fighter planes that have caught the attention of foreign militaries seeking to modernize their airforce. If we should allow them to export their planes, the experience gained from modifying the base design to different specifications would no doubt be quite valuable for our own development projects."
 ITA_diving_bombers: "Diving Bombers"
 ITA_diving_bombers_desc: "The topic of Close Air Support has gained considerable importance in military circles. While planes have long been used to drop bombs, it appears that several countries have started to develop specialized planes that can place a bomb with unmatched accuracy by diving from high altitude. While our industry could no doubt produce such a plane in time, there are other countries that have designs for this very purpose."
 ITA_superaereo: "Superaereo"
 ITA_superaereo_desc: "The days of small groups of planes flying here and there are long gone. A modern air campaign is in many ways similar in complexity to any land-based undertaking. As such, we need a specialized planning staff to coordinate our various squadrons so they can act together to accomplish their missions."
 ITA_officers_of_the_service_role: "Officers of the Service Role"
 ITA_officers_of_the_service_role_desc: "It is no longer sufficient to simply take officers from the army and teach them how to fly. Our airforce requires a new breed of officer, one that was raised and molded by the service instead of merely adopting it."
 ITA_standardization: "Standardization"
 ITA_standardization_desc: "The war in the air, more so than the war at sea and the war on land, is a war of industry against industry. Mass and mass alone is decisive. We must ensure that we can produce as many planes as possible, even if this means that it becomes more difficult to change designs later."
 ITA_specialization: "Specialization"
 ITA_specialization_desc: "Try as we might, we will never be able to match the bigger powers in terms of raw output. The only way we can compete in the air is by building better planes than anyone else. Each of them will have to be able to win a fight even when outnumbered three or four to one."
 ITA_multirole_aircraft: "Multi-Role Aircraft"
 ITA_multirole_aircraft_desc: "By developing airframes capable of performing different roles in combat we can achieve a significant reduction in production costs and crew training time. We will put our engineers to work on designing these kind of versatile airframes immediately."
 ITA_long_range_aircraft: "Long Range Aircraft"
 ITA_long_range_aircraft_desc: "Enemy bases, industries and supply lines are often well behind the front lines. We need to develop and improve our long-range aircraft so that they can reach and hit these vital targets."
 ITA_fighter_designs: "Fighter Designs"
 ITA_fighter_designs_desc: "Fighters are the backbone of any air force. We must ensure that our fighter aircraft have the means to impose air superiority in the skies and protect our bombers on the way to their targets."
 ITA_bomber_designs: "Bomber Designs"
 ITA_bomber_designs_desc: "With new designs for our bombers our air force will be able to support our forces on land and sea while threatening enemy troops and their supply lines."
 ITA_supremacy_in_the_skies: "Supremacy in the Skies"
 ITA_supremacy_in_the_skies_desc: "A modern army cannot operate successfully without the support of a powerful airforce. It is of utmost importance that our country has state-of-the-art aircraft and technology to dominate the skies."
 ITA_naval_power_projection: "Naval Power Projection"
 ITA_naval_power_projection_desc: "Following the legacy of our ancestors, we must ensure that we have the necessary industry to develop a formidable naval force capable of maintaining Italian supremacy in the Mediterranean over any other navy."
 ITA_intensify_torpedo_manufacturing: "Intensify Torpedo Manufacturing"
 ITA_intensify_torpedo_manufacturing_desc: "Italian torpedoes are among the most reliable in the world. Fiume was the birthplace of the torpedo, and with the factory there and the Silurificio Italiano plant at Naples, we have a good foundation on which to further expand our use of this deadly naval weapon."
 ITA_expand_naval_facilities: "Expand Naval Facilities"
 ITA_expand_naval_facilities_desc: "A first-class navy does not just need a strong battlefleet, but also the ports and dockyards to support it. By investing in our naval infrastructure, our navy will have the bases and the construction and repair capacity it needs when war breaks out."
 ITA_oto_naval_guns: "OTO Naval Guns"
 ITA_oto_naval_guns_desc: "Italy relies on the firms of Ansaldo and Oderi-Terni-Orlando for the big guns of its capital ships. By making targeted investments in their capacity, we can make our battleships the envy of the world."
 ITA_improve_overseas_naval_bases: "Improve Overseas Naval Bases"

 ITA_milizia_marittima_di_artiglieria: "Milizia Marittima di Artiglieria"
 ITA_milizia_marittima_di_artiglieria_desc: "Italy has an extensive coastline and isolated island ports, vulnerable to invasion. By reforming our Milizia Costiera and investing in our coastal defenses we can ensure any invaders pay a heavy price."
 ITA_supermarina: "Supermarina"
 ITA_supermarina_desc: "A modern operations center should be established for the Regia Marina's Commander-in-Chief, to coordinate the operations of our naval formations throughout the Mediterranean and beyond."
 ITA_stockpile_fuel: "Stockpile Fuel"
 ITA_stockpile_fuel_desc: "Oil is the blood that runs in the veins of our ships, without which the fleet would be render inactive. With Italy lacking substantial domestic oil supplies, it is vital to build oil storage tanks and fill them, to sustain our forces even if future conflicts cut us off from imports."
 ITA_forza_navale_especiale: "Forza Navale Speciale"
 ITA_forza_navale_especiale_desc: "The capacity to make amphibious landings is likely to prove invaluable to any conflict in the Mediterranean. By setting up a Special Naval Force, trained and equipped for amphibious operations, we will be able to project power from the sea at any point of the long Mediterranean coastline."
 ITA_naval_air_coordination: "Naval-Air Coordination"
 ITA_naval_air_coordination_desc: "Up until now the air force high command has followed its own doctrine and not coordinated well with the navy. This has limited the Regia Marina's capacity to undertake effective reconnaissance. By developing a joint naval-air doctrine and streamlining communications between naval and air units, our ships will be better able to find and strike the enemy."
 ITA_decima_flottiglia_mas: "Decima Flottiglia MAS"
 ITA_decima_flottiglia_mas_desc: "Teseo Tesei and Elios Toschi of the Genio Navale have designed a self-propelled torpedo that can be used to infiltrate enemy ports – by funding the development of this and other unique weapons, and training a special operations unit to use them, we may be able to achieve dramatic, unexpected victories over our enemies."
 ITA_incrociatori_leggeri: "Incrociatori Leggeri"
 ITA_incrociatori_leggeri_desc: "Fast and powerful enough to take on other light cruisers and sweep destroyers before them, but cheap enough to build in numbers, light cruisers are important in protecting our sea lanes, and in taking the fight to enemy convoys. By building on our experience with the Condottieri, Montecuccoli and Garibaldi classes, we can create a cruiser force to dominate the seas between Europe and Africa."
 ITA_incrociatori_pesanti: "Incrociatori Pesanti"
 ITA_incrociatori_pesanti_desc: "For now, Italy lacks the industrial base to build enough battleships for them to be everywhere we need them at once. By building powerful, well-armored cruisers like our Zara class, we will have the ships to contest control of the seas across multiple areas of operation."
 ITA_expand_naval_intelligence: "Expand Naval Intelligence"
 ITA_expand_naval_intelligence_desc: "Italian signals intelligence has run on a small budget for many years, relying on the considerable talents of Giorgio Verità Poeta and Luigi Donini, but this will only go so far. By providing them with more staff, and enlisting new talents like Lieutenant Eliso Porto, we will stand a better chance of cracking enemies' codes and discovering the location of their forces."
 ITA_cooperation_programs: "Cooperation Programs"
 ITA_cooperation_programs_desc: "Our robust shipbuilding and armaments industry has a recent history of building warships for other nations, like Greece's Hydra class destroyers, or assisting with design, such as that provided to the USSR for their Project 7 ships. Seeking out similar opportunities could help further develop our industrial base for the trials that lie ahead."
 ITA_cruiser_submarines: "Cruiser Submarines"
 ITA_cruiser_submarines_desc: "To attack the sea lanes of enemies that lie outside the Mediterranean, we need long-range submarines that can roam the oceans. Providing further support to our extensive post-WW1 submarine program, based largely on the work of engineers Cavallini and Bernardis, will help us achieve this goal."
 ITA_midget_submarines: "Midget Submarines"
 ITA_midget_submarines_desc: "The clear waters of the Mediterranean are dangerous for larger submarines. Building small, short-range, low-visibility boats can enhance their chances at surviving in a Mediterranean environment, and give us the force we need to patrol important choke-points like the Sicilian Channel."
 ITA_cacciatorpediniere_di_scorta: "Cacciatorpediniere di Scorta"
 ITA_cacciatorpediniere_di_scorta_desc: "One of the [GetAppropriateRegiaMarinaNsName]'s core tasks is to protect the sea lanes between Italy, North Africa, and our Mediterranean Islands.

 ITA_proper_carriers: "Proper Carriers"
 ITA_proper_carriers_desc: "Innovative designers like Luigi Gagnotto have produced fleet carrier designs throughout the last decade. Using this expertise, along with the existing hull of the fast liner Roma (but with new, more powerful engines), we can get an operational carrier more quickly than building from the keel up."
 ITA_refit_civilian_ships: "Refit Civilian Ships"
 ITA_refit_civilian_ships_desc: "While proper fleet carriers are far more capable, if we want carriers quickly corners need to be cut. By converting existing passenger liners like Rex and Conte di Savoia we can get air cover for our fleet quickly."
 ITA_flotta_d_evasione: "Flotta d'Evasione"
 ITA_flotta_d_evasione_desc: "For too long Italy has been content to limit its naval ambitions to the Mediterranean and Red Sea.

 ITA_ethiopian_war_logistics_bba: "Ethiopian War Logistics"
 ITA_ethiopian_war_logistics_bba_desc: "From the lack of progress in Ethiopia, it is becoming clear that we have underestimated how many supplies a modern army really needs.

 ITA_the_abyssinian_fiasco: "The Abyssinian Fiasco"
 ITA_the_abyssinian_fiasco_desc: "Our invasion of Ethiopia has turned into a disaster. Once again, we are faced with the shameful display of an Italian army failing to overcome an Ethiopian one. Like our forefathers at Adwa, we have been beaten. We can only guess what a defeat of this magnitude means for the future of the fascist system in Italy."
 ITA_solid_progress: "Solid Progress"

 ITA_struggle_in_ethiopia: "Struggle in Ethiopia"
 ITA_struggle_in_ethiopia_desc: "Our progress in Ethiopia is well behind schedule, but we can not allow a minor setback such as this to demoralize us. Italian arms and the fascist system will prevail - whatever the cost."
 ITA_undermine_the_duce: "Undermine the Duce"
 ITA_undermine_the_duce_desc: "Mussolini's mad desire to conquer Ethiopia has once again led us to the brink of defeat. While victory is certainly still possible, it must be clear that this will not be Mussolini's victory."
 ITA_conspiracies_in_the_shadows: "Conspiracies in the Shadows"
 ITA_conspiracies_in_the_shadows_desc: "Whispers in the halls of power are voicing their dissatisfaction with Mussolini more and more. Conspiracies are woven and alliances formed between people that usually have little in common. The time for change is fast approaching."
 ITA_servizio_informazione_militare: "Servizio Informazioni Militare"

 ITA_devaluate_the_lire: "Devaluate the Lire"
 ITA_devaluate_the_lire_desc: "The war has been a lot more costly than we would have liked. Our economy struggles under the after-effects. Devaluing our currency will make our products more competitive on the international market, but will make the life of the average Italian a little harder - a necessary sacrifice that they will happily make."
 ITA_anglo_italian_agreements: "Anglo-Italian Agreements"
 ITA_anglo_italian_agreements_desc: "With the new reality in East Africa, the other colonial powers must come to terms with us. We need them to allow us passage through the Suez, but they need us far more. If they refuse, we might just have to look elsewhere for support."
 ITA_topple_amhara_rulers: "Topple Amhara Rulers"
 ITA_topple_amhara_rulers_desc: "Ethiopia is a far more diverse and splintered country than most believe. There are many groups that are not strong supporters of the old Ethiopian regime.

 ITA_the_new_emperor_of_ethiopia_desc: "The people of Ethiopia have lived under an emperor for centuries. It would doubtlessly make our task far simpler if we could just present them with a new Emperor to replace their old one, by crowning our King as the new Emperor."
 ITA_ministero_della_cultura_popolare: "Ministero della Cultura Popolare"

 ITA_la_battaglia_del_grano: "La Battaglia del Grano"
 ITA_la_battaglia_del_grano_desc: "A country can not be considered truly great if it depends on other countries to feed it.

 ITA_la_battaglia_per_la_terra: "La Battaglia per la Terra"

 HOF_BBA_italo_ethiopian_war_events.01.t: "End of Spring Offensive"
 HOF_BBA_italo_ethiopian_war_events.01.desc: "Our forces are stagnating on the Abyssinian battlefield and are even being counterattacked in some areas. This "spring offensive" made Nero angry at the incompetence of the high command. The emperor wanted results, now, immediately, immediately. \n\nIn view of the present situation, the Emperor authorized the military to use all possible means to defeat Abyssinia, and the war must be ended quickly - at any cost."

 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.02_north.t: "The northern front is stalemated"
 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.02_north.desc: "Our forces' counterattack in northern Abyssinia has not met with the expected success. The emperor was convinced that the world not only regarded her as a laughing stock, but also laughed at the stalemate of the war. Nero began to consider whether she needed to take over the northern front herself to ensure that the troops were dispatched properly."

 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.04_south.t: "Stalemate on the southern front"
 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.04_south.desc: "The counterattack launched on the southern Abyssinian front did not yield the results the leader had expected, so she spent hours complaining about what a bunch of wimps he had surrounded himself with. It seemed that Nero was convinced that the entire high command was deliberately working against her. In her mind, even the generals couldn't wait to lose the whole war."

 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.03_north.t: "The victory in northern Ethiopia"
 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.03_north.desc: "The troops on the northern Abyssinian front managed to repel a ferocious enemy offensive. For such troops and battle results, Nero was only full of admiration. She never doubted the strength of our troops - as long as they could muster the energy and employ the means to win under the emperor's inspiration."

 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.05_south.t: "The victory in southern Ethiopia"
 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.05_south.desc: "Nero was overjoyed by the progress on the southern Abyssinian front, and she praised the bravery shown by the Italian army and the sacrifices made by our troops to end this conflict. Her Majesty never had the slightest doubt that our troops were capable of victory on the battlefield - provided they were properly supported by the Emperor."

 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.31.t: "Industrialization Project"
 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.31.desc: "In order to revive Rome, the emperor established a plan to increase production capacity. To realize the vision of becoming a rich and powerful nation, we need more factories to keep the empire thriving."

 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.32.t: "The industrialization process lagged behind"
 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.32.desc: "The emperor was very unhappy with the lagging progress of the country's industrial construction. Nero bemoaned the fact that he did not hinder others, but rather that he himself was so tied up that his great work of enriching Rome was difficult to achieve."

 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.33.t: "The success of the industrialization project"
 HOF_BBA_italy_missiolinis.33.desc: "Nero praised the new factory as the cornerstone of the modernization of Italian industry. The emperor was very pleased that the new factory both increased the country's production capacity and helped greatly in furthering his vision of Roman revival."

Unlike the crazy Spartacus who intended to carry out unlimited class cleansing, the Carnaro Charter adopted the class reconciliation model advocated by state unionism, and everything in the country, regardless of class, was United under one leader.

But the mass movement soon made it difficult for the government to carry out its work, and even the supply lines scheduled to be sent to the front lines of the war in Libya were paralyzed, although the Libyan governor, General Rodolfo Graziani, persisted and defeated the Libyans. but the heavy casualties have sparked an anti-war craze at home, and some equally radical movements are on the rise."

The magazine system uses en bloc charger clips which were originally developed by Ferdinand Mannlicher - hence why the gun is often referred to as the 'Mannlicher-Carcano.' Popular during the Weltkrieg and the civil war, the M91 is a staple in the Italian Federation's military."

The MAB-38 can be recognised by its machined steel receiver, fine craftsmanship, and perforated cooling jacket over the barrel. The gun fires 9x19mm Parabellum at 600 rounds per minute, making it a deadly weapon in close quarters and urban combat. Interestingly enough, the gun features two triggers for two firing modes; the fore trigger is for semi-automatic fire while the rear trigger is for fully automatic."

The FNAB-42 uses a delayed-blowback system that fires from a closed bolt position - this allows the rate of fire to be kept at a steady 400 rpm without having to use a heavy bolt and strong spring. The complexity of this weapon reflects the latest sophistication of Italian ingenuity."

The firing rate and low magazine capacity makes the weapon more ideal as a semi-automatic rifle instead of a light machine gun. The Mortaio 81 is a lightweight Brandt-style mortar that has seen great feedback in the testing ranges due to its range capacity and reliability. The mortar uses two shells; one heavy high-explosive shell and another lighter shell for long-distance fire."
  ITA_support_weapons3: "Breda M37 & Mortaio da 81 CEMSA L.P."
  ITA_support_weapons3_desc: "The Breda M37 is a medium machine gun produced by Breda. The gas-operated air cooled medium machine gun is fairly reliable in the field. Its slow rate of fire helps prevent overheating during prolonged fire and its powerful heavy bullet cartridge has excellent range and penetration."
  ITA_support_weapons4: "Breda Mod.5C & Mortaio da 81 CEMSA L.P"
  ITA_support_weapons4_desc: "The Breda Mod.5C is an Italian heavy machine gun. A reflection of Italian military doctrine, the Breda was intended for ambushes and attacks. While its rate of fire is slow (as with most Italian machine guns); the Breda 5C was still regarded as one of the deadliest weapons in the Italian arsenal given the Italian Army's lack of heavy machine guns and submachine guns."
  ITA_infantry_weapons2: "Beretta M1918/38"
  ITA_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Beretta M1918 is an Italian sub-machine gun used during the Weltkrieg. The gun was made from half of a Villar-Perosa aircraft submachine gun and features an incredible rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute. The 1938 variant features the same rate of fire as the iconic weapon but has been refined to reduce the weapon's recoil and increase its sturdiness."
  ITA_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Pavesi M40"
  ITA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The Pavesi M40 is an Italian semi-auto rifle chambered for the 8x59 Breda cartridge. It is a short recoil action with 4-lug rotating bolt and uses a Mannlicher bloc clip."
  ITA_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "TZ-44"
  ITA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "Designed by a colonel and gunsmith (Tonon and Zorzoli hence the name 'TZ'); the TZ-44 is an impressive sub-machine gun capable of firing 9x19mm Parabellum at 800 rounds per minute. The gun action is simple blowback but the return spring is assembled around a guide rod which is in two pieces and telescopes as the bolt returns. Like other Italian weapons, the gun features selective fire. It also features a noteworthy 'double safety' to ensure that accidental discharges would not happen."

  ITA_train_equipment_1_desc: "Designed by the Adriatic Railways shortly before the nationalisation of the railways in 1905, the 740 Group is a series of 'Consolidation' class locomotives. Built to haul heavy trains on the mountainous lines of the Northern Appennine, while keeping a comparatively low axle load of 14 tons to run on older, less frequently mantained tracks, these engines excelled in their task, and were subsequently built in copious number before the Great War. Distributed across the Peninsula to relieve the older pre-nationalisation engines, a good number of those engines ended up hauling heavy military trains (tradotte) during the War, and subsequently remained in our hands."
  ITA_train_equipment_2: "FS Gruppo 480"
  ITA_train_equipment_2_short: "FS Gr. 480"
  ITA_train_equipment_2_desc: "An evolution of the Austrian design for the pre-war Südbahn 580 Class, the 480 Group is a series of 'Decapod' class locomotives designed with heavy service on the Brenner Line towards Central Europe in mind. Though their higher axle load compared to their predecessors makes them harder to operate on older lines, various improvements such as the Caprotti valve gear make them both more powerful and cheaper to operate."
