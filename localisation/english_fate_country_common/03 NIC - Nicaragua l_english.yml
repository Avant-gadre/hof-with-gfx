##Equip-land
 NIC_infantry_equipment_0: "Springfield Krag-Jørgensen Modelo 1898"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Springfield M1898"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Krag-Jørgensen rifle was adopted by the United States in 1892 to replace the ageing Springfield Model 1884. While the Krags proved superior at close ranges to comparable Mauser designs in the Spanish-American war, the rifle's flimsy action in comparison to newer bolt designs necessitated a replacement a mere decade after its adoption. During the American occupations of several Central American nations in the early 20th century, many stockpiled Krag rifles, mostly of the 1898 rifle pattern, were given to local forces along with droves of surplus ammunition."
 NIC_infantry_equipment_1: "Carabina del Pueblo Modelo 1934"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Carabina M1934"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "With the socialist revolution, Nicaragua found itself with a rapidly ageing stock of surplus American Krags and little ammunition to supply its meagre arsenal. To alleviate these problems, in 1934, it began an ambitious effort to retrofit and convert its Krag rifles to carbines chambered in 7.5×54mm French, which had successfully been smuggled into the country in large quantities."
 NIC_infantry_equipment_2: "Metralleta Modelo 1935"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Metralleta M1935"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "While Nicaragua had yet to formally adopt a submachine prior to the socialist revolution, many Model 1921 Thompsons had entered the country along with the capability of domestic manufacturers to produce .45 ACP ammunition. The Metralleta Model 1935 is a Nicaraguan modified Thompson 1921 with several upgrades and a simplified manufacturing process."
 NIC_infantry_equipment_3: "MAS Modèle 1940/42"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_3_short: "MAS-40/42"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The MAS-40/42 is the latest in a series of Communard semi-automatic rifles. Unlike its predecessors, however, the MAS-40/42 was found to be exceptionally reliable in French military testing. The original five round internal magazine, however, was deemed insufficient and a new variant of the MAS-40/42, the 40/42, was developed featuring a detachable ten round box magazine. A small number of MAS-40/42 rifles were smuggled into Nicaragua along with production tooling specifications."
