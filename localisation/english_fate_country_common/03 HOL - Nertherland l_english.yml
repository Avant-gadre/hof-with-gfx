 HOL_request_aid_for_the_engelandvaarders_desc: "The over 100 miles of North Sea separating England from the Netherlands is no deterrent to Dutchmen seeking to escape the occupation and fight alongside their countrymen for the liberation of the homeland. In rickety small rowboats or kayaks, these "Engelandvaarders" or "England Sailers" brave the open waters, in conditions so difficult that fewer than one in ten survive the voyage. Merely attempting this puts them among the very bravest of the brave, and it is our duty to ask the British to do whatever they can to increase the likelihood of their success."
 VEN_abc_islands: "The ABC Islands"
 VEN_abc_islands_desc: "The ABC Islands lie just off our shores, and by all accounts should rightfully belong to us. Not only does their geographical proximity make this a natural state of affairs, but almost all of our oil is refined on these islands as well, making them hugely important for our economy.

 HOL_obtain_foreign_colonial_investments_tt: "These allow for temporary bonuses to §YConsumer Goods§! and §YConstruction Speed§!, as well as permanent increases in §YOil§! production in the East and West Indies.\n"
 HOL_the_western_possessions: "The Western Possessions"
 HOL_the_western_possessions_desc: "The West Indies are often overlooked in favor of their Eastern counterparts, but they are rich in resources of their own. Assuring the infrastructure is adequate is the first step towards potentially increasing the industry and resource extraction in the area."

 HOL_expand_curacao_oil_refineries_desc: "Owing to the shallow depth of Lake Maracaibo, since 1918 virtually all Venezuelan oil is instead shipped by shallow-draft coastal transport to be processed on Aruba and Curaçao, and from there shipped across the world in ocean-going tankers. Our refineries there are currently already the largest in the world, but the upcoming world crisis might well warrant even further expansion of the facilities."

 HOL_open_second_paranam_bauxite_mine: "Open Second Paranam Bauxite Mine"
 HOL_open_second_paranam_bauxite_mine_desc: "Bauxite from Suriname is of tremendous importance to the production of aluminum for the major powers' airplane industries.

 HOL_antilles_defenses: "Antilles Defenses"
 HOL_antilles_defenses_desc: "Considering the huge importance of our oil refineries on Aruba and Curaçao, it is not strange that foreign parties with a vested interest in them seem very nervous about the weak state of our defenses here. If we want to avoid these parties feeling the need to defend the islands for us, perhaps we should see to improving the defenses ourselves..."
 HOL_pre_empt_venezuelan_aggression_tt: "Does not have national spirit §YShell-shocked Spectator of the Great War§!"
 HOL_pre_empt_venezuelan_aggression: "Pre-Empt Venezuelan Aggression"
 HOL_pre_empt_venezuelan_aggression_desc: "The Venezuelans have made their designs on our Antilles more than clear. They may have tried to simply 'offer their protection' this time around, but there is no telling what they might be driven to if our situation should deteriorate. We must strike before they do, and ensure the security of our oil refineries."
 HOL_the_crown_jewel_colony: "The Crown Jewel Colony"
 HOL_the_crown_jewel_colony_desc: "As India is to the British, so are the East Indies to us. However, the current, out-dated infrastructure in the East Indies simply will not do in this modern age.

 HOL_java: "Java"
 HOL_java_desc: "Tha capital island of our East Indies should be heavily invested into, so that we bring it more in line with the proper degree of industrialisation for the day."
 HOL_reinforce_java: "Reinforce Java"
 HOL_reinforce_java_desc: "Java houses the largest part of the East Indian archipelago's population and industry, as well as its capital and all the major military bases and headquarters. Consequently, it is by far the most important island of the East Indies, and we should improve its defenses to ensure we can remain in control of it even if all else is lost."
 HOL_the_foundations_of_defense: "The "Foundations of Defense""
 HOL_the_foundations_of_defense_desc: "The "Defensiegrondslagen van Nederlands-Indië" was a report drafted in 1927, analyzing the defensibility of our colonies. With the recent increase in Japanese aggression, and knowing full well their designs on the East Indies, perhaps this document should be dusted off, and the defensive weak points it identifies prioritized for the allocation of our newly freed-up resources."
 HOL_the_foundations_of_defense_tt: "Set §YNaval Base§! to maximum level in Soerabaja.\n"
 HOL_sumatra: "Sumatra"
 HOL_sumatra_desc: "Though the largest contiguous landmass entirely part of the East Indies, Sumatra, Java's northern neighbour, has fallen well behind in industrialization and infrastructure. We should remedy this at once."

 HOL_borneo_and_the_grote_oost_desc: "The great island of Borneo, and the other islands collectively known as 'De Grote Oost' ('The Great East'), such as Sulawesi and the Moluccas, should be made more accessible to our growing population, allowing more industry to settle in these areas."
 HOL_curtail_colonial_autonomy: "Curtail Colonial Autonomy"
 HOL_curtail_colonial_autonomy_desc: "It may well be possible that the continental Netherlands are overrun despite our best preparations. In this case, we should look to alternatives, and one possibility would be to relocate the government to the capital of the Dutch East Indies, in the city of Batavia on Java. We should make it clear to our colonial administration that we may soon take direct control of their affairs, instead."
 HOL_continue_the_war_in_batavia: "Continue the War in Batavia"
 HOL_continue_the_war_in_batavia_desc: "The invasion we feared has come to pass, and our defenses have been swept aside. The government has managed to escape and is now in exile, hosted by our allies. Though our Queen would rather that the government remain in exile and 'close to the action' in Europe, we think the time has come to relocate to the East Indies, and from there continue the war as a sovereign power."

 HOL_expand_the_colonial_army: "Expand the Colonial Army"

 HOL_colonial_shipbuilding: "Colonial Shipbuilding"
 HOL_colonial_shipbuilding_desc: "With the fall of the Netherlands, our continental shipyards were lost. We must put aside resources to create new shipyards in the East, if we are to build up our naval forces."

 HOL_prepare_for_our_return_desc: "We require large quantities of shipping to transport our troops back to the continent if we wish to aid in the liberation of our homeland. More shipyards and perfecting the craft of building cargo ships should see to this need."
 HOL_liberation: "Liberation"
 HOL_liberation_desc: "Our homeland is liberated, and the armies that surrendered upon our capitulation have been freed and are eager for their revenge. Morale soars as jubilant crowds greet the liberators, and the people will not suffer another invader lightly."
 HOL_abandon_the_gold_standard: "Abandon the Gold Standard"
 HOL_abandon_the_gold_standard_desc: "Refusing to drop the Gold Standard has cost us tremendous resources these past years. Now that France has left the Gold Bloc, only the Swiss and ourselves remain. The time has come to allow the devaluation of the Guilder, and to use the freed-up resources to improve the sorry state of our defenses."
 HOL_continue_the_public_works: "Continue the Public Works"
 HOL_continue_the_public_works_desc: "We must continue the great public works started in the late 1920s. The reclamation of land and the construction of new canals, roads, and tunnels not only creates jobs, but also serves to improve the nation."
 HOL_finish_the_noordoostpolder: "Finish the Noordoostpolder"
 HOL_finish_the_noordoostpolder_desc: "After closing off the Zuiderzee by building the Afsluitdijk, and thereby creating the artificial IJsselmeer lake, we must now finish the land reclamation project of the Noordoostpolder. This will give us better infrastructure and more room for industrial and agricultural expansion."
 HOL_the_maastunnel: "The Maastunnel"
 HOL_the_maastunnel_desc: "Our great rivers are phenomenal obstacles, but by digging tunnels under them we can drastically improve our infrastructure. The Maastunnel will be the first of these, greatly improving accessibility to the city of Rotterdam from the south."
 HOL_expand_the_artillerieinrichtingen: "Expand the Artillerieinrichtingen"
 HOL_expand_the_artillerieinrichtingen_desc: "The Artillerie-Inrichtingen manufactures munitions and a small number of small arms (under license) for our forces. It should be expanded if we aim to increase our military."

 HOL_expand_RD_facilities: "Expand R&D Facilities"
 HOL_expand_RD_facilities_desc: "Our industrial expansion and other recent advances might allow us to conduct more R&D in parallel, especially if we expand upon Philips' already-existing facilities."
 HOL_the_zuiderzee_works: "Continue the Zuiderzee Works"
 HOL_the_zuiderzee_works_desc: "The next stage of land reclamation is the Flevopolder, named after the ancient Flevo lake first mentioned in Roman times. This is a tremendous project that will take many years to be fully finished, but even in the short term it will provide us with ample rewards."
 HOL_develop_the_randstad: "Develop the Randstad"
 HOL_develop_the_randstad_desc: "By developing our largest cities and the areas connecting them even further, we can lay the foundations of what some are already starting to refer to as the 'Rim City'; a roughly circular urban area connecting the major cities of Amsterdam, Den Haag, Rotterdam, and Utrecht, surrounding the 'Groene Hart' or 'Green Heart' at the center of the 'rim'."
 HOL_expand_the_ijmuiden_steel_mill: "Expand the IJmuiden Steel Mill"

 HOL_fokker_tt: "Unlocks §YFokker§! as an Aircraft Designer.\n"
 HOL_domestic_jet_engine_designs: "Domestic Jet Engine Designs"
 HOL_domestic_jet_engine_designs_desc: "Our innovative aircraft builders should be encouraged to experiment with futuristic designs. Though the result may not immediately be a functioning jet engine aircraft, it will undoubtedly result in improvements in production of aircraft in general."
 HOL_develop_the_zandstad: "Develop the Zandstad"
 HOL_develop_the_zandstad_desc: "Rather than focus all of our efforts in building up our largest cities, we should distribute new industry more among the outlying areas."
 HOL_friesland_agricultural_impetus: "Friesland Agricultural Impetus"

 HOL_daf: "DAF"

 HOL_make_use_of_our_riches: "Make Use of Our Riches"
 HOL_make_use_of_our_riches_desc: "Our nation possesses the resources of a major power while wearing the garb of a minor one. Perhaps if we make better use of the riches that are available to us, we may well ascend to the middling level, if not take our place among the dominant powers of the world once again."
 HOL_the_ultimate_deterrent: "The Ultimate Deterrent"
 HOL_the_ultimate_deterrent_desc: "A powerful air force and a powerful navy are all nice and well, but what would truly deter anyone from attacking our colonies, or otherwise violating our neutrality, would be the development of an atomic bomb."

 HOL_prepare_the_inundation_lines_desc: "Ever since our independence war against the Spanish in the 16th century, inundation, or intentional flooding of the land, has been an integral part of our defenses.

 HOL_protect_against_britain: "Protect Against Britain"

 HOL_southward_defenses: "Southward Defenses"
 HOL_southward_defenses_desc: "We must establish a defensive line along the Meuse river, to thwart any northward push through Belgium. A further, final strengthening of our coastal defenses should definitively smash any potential British plans to land an expeditionary force in our harbors."

 HOL_fortress_holland: "Fortress Holland"
 HOL_fortress_holland_desc: "We must bet everything on Fortress Holland. The area north of the great rivers and west of the IJsselmeer encompasses by far the larger part of our population and industry. Sacrificing the rest of the country might allow us to hold out long enough in our industrialized area for a more powerful ally to come to our aid in time."
 HOL_modernize_the_grebbeline: "Modernize the Grebbe Line"
 HOL_modernize_the_grebbeline_desc: "The southern front of Fortress Holland is well-defended by the great rivers the Rhine and the Meuse. This leaves only a gap to the east of Amsterdam, between the IJsselmeer to the north and the Rhine to the south. The defensive line located here, the Grebbe Line, must be modernized and reinforced if it is to hold against determined assault."
 HOL_war_on_pacifism: "War on Pacifism"
 HOL_war_on_pacifism_desc: "Ever since the Great War, pacifism has run rampant among the Dutch public, making it practically impossible to form a modern military. For too long has the 'Will of the People' prevented the full allocation of required funds to the military. They know not the danger they expose themselves to... We will declare a war upon Pacifism, and banish this unproductive sentiment from the minds of our populace!"

 HOL_appoint_new_supreme_commander: "Appoint New Supreme Commander"
 HOL_appoint_new_supreme_commander_desc: "Our supreme commander is proving to be rather obstinate in his adherence to outright impossible defensive plans. He should be replaced. Henri Winkelman could be recalled from retirement, and would likely prove a more... amenable alternative."

 HOL_production_under_license: "Production Under License"

 HOL_unsinkable_aircraft_carriers_desc: "With the advent of the third dimension of warfare we should see to ensuring adequate air cover for our fleet.

 HOL_gateway_to_europe_desc: "The Netherlands is the gateway of trade into Europe, a fact that is well understood by our trade partners. Though, while our position gives us strength, it also puts us in an unenviable predicament: while the British aim to blockade their likely enemies on the continent, the Germans wish for us to increase the flow of trade to their country through ours, using us as a back door to avoid the blockade."
