We were unprepared, and the situation has only grown more untenable. The refugees are now being politically organized under Georgios Kosmidis, another Anatolian exile.

 GRE_depose_the_reactionaries: "Depose the Reactionaries"

 GRE_dominate_the_bulgarians: "Dominate the Bulgarians"

 GRE_ACHIEVING_ENOSIS_FOCUS_DESCRIPTION_ALTERNATE: "Cyprus has and will always be Greek. Perhaps we were not ready before when the British robbed us of our chance at unification, but now that Cyprus has secured its independence surely it has come time to make right past wrongs!
