 AST_White_Australia_Policy: "White Australia Policy"
 AST_White_Australia_Policy_desc: "Since the enactment of the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 and the Island Labour Actof 1901 , [AST.GetName] has pursued a policy of harsh anti-Asian racial discrimination to "ensure racial purity". Despite the Conservatives' policy, the trade union movement and the Labour Party supported this policy in order to exclude non-native workers. The British governments in London and Camelot were very unhappy with this discriminatory policy, but they did not try to prevent the passage of the series of bills, and some politicians even expressed sympathy for the policy. It is worth noting, however, that as a result of the Commonwealth Franchise Act of 1902, the Māori were excluded from this series of policies, and they were granted full civil rights in this country.""

 AST_infantry_equipment_0_short: "LSAF SMLE Mk III"
 AST_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Lithgow Small Arms Factory in New South Wales opened in 1912, starting local production of the venerable Lee-Enfield rifle that would serve throughout the Great War. After the British Revolution, however, and the fall of large parts of British India, LSAF was the last remaining arsenal capable of producing Lee-Enfields to remain in Entente hands, making it a very important strategic asset."
 AST_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk VI"
 AST_infantry_equipment_1_short: "LSAF SMLE Mk VI"
 AST_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "In cooperation with British-Canadian engineers and the Lithgow factory, the Lee-Enfield Mk III was modernised with new and improved aperture sights on the receiver instead of at the mid-point of the rifle, becoming the new standard for the Dominions. However, experience in jungle warfare brought to attention new needs for the service rifle, specifically in weight, length, and handling. Lithgow thus developed the \"Jungle carbine\" (a commercial name from the post-war), featuring a 18.75 inches (476mm) barrel compared to 25.2 inches (640mm) of the Mk III and V."
 AST_infantry_equipment_2: "Carbine, Machine, Owen Mk I"
 AST_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Gun"
 AST_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the looming war and experience during the war in the US, the Entente armies grew increasingly interested in a mass-producible submachine-gun. Evelyn Owen, a private in the Australasian Army and hobbyist gunsmith, caught the attention of both Canadian and Australasian armies with a design of his own. The Owen gun was a very simple, but unorthodox design with its top-loaded magazine and two vertical grips. Not only is it relatively inexpensive, but it proved to be extremely rugged, surviving in even the worst of conditions, earning it the nickname \"Digger's Darling\"."
 AST_infantry_equipment_3: "Rifle, Self-Loading, Long Branch Mk I"
 AST_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk I"
 AST_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 AST_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 AST_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 AST_infantry_at2: "Projector Infantry Tank Attack Mk I"
 AST_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector Infantry Tank Attack (PITA, known as Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank/PIAT in other Dominions) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."

 AST_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "With the success of the Rover under its belt, the Ruskin Motor Bodies company designed the Rhino in response to an Australasian government request for a substantially heavier armoured car built upon the CMP chassis. Though substantial changes were made to that CMP chassis, after much work the Rhino was born, and with substantial interchangeability of parts with other CMP-based designs to boot."
 AST_armored_car_at_equipment: "Ruskin Hippo"
 AST_armored_car_at_equipment_short: "Hippo"
 AST_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "To accommodate a substantially larger gun, the Rhino's coaxial machine had to be removed and its turret slightly enlarged. The 'Hippo' as this model has been designated, proved to be quite the headache for its design team, as these changes caused the already heavy vehicle to run into weight issues like its predecessors which had to be slowly worked out prior to the vehicle's adoption."
