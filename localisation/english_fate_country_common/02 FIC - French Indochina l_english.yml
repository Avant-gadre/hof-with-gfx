But we can't. The French local fleet has to face this ancient enemy and the new enemy in the east at the same time. We are preparing to apply for the purchase of new combat ships, but we should first protect ourselves before responding in our country. Coastal defense ships with small tonnage and large artillery caliber will be our good choice. Designers from the local area have referred to the Swedish coastal defense ship. However, many Swedish designs have long been outdated. The final drawings of the designers have a much cleaner deck. There is a dual 305mm/45 Mle 1906 master on the bow and stern. For the gun, two 100mm/45 Mle 1930 dual-purpose guns were installed on the left and right sides of the hull. The full-load displacement of the entire ship reached 8,700 tons. Due to the limited technical capabilities in the region, we could only use outdated engines with a maximum speed of only 20 knots. And because the hull is too small, the crew's living space is also greatly restricted."
 ficn.1.a: "Hope it will come in handy."
    
 ficn.2.t: "Protect the Routes"
 ficn.2.d: "Another important component of the escort formation is the frigate. The local large destroyer is not suitable for our current situation. We put forward a request to the local designer to design a new type of frigate, and they also agreed. Of course, we paid extra In the case of wages. In order to meet the needs of anti-submarine escort and the backward productivity in colonial areas, the new frigate was designed as a small ship with a displacement of only about 1,200 tons and a speed of 24 knots. Each ship has a 100mm/45 Modèle 1930 dual-purpose gun on the bow and stern. 10 brand-new single-loaded Oerlikon cannons are installed throughout the hull. The anti-submarine side is equipped with a hedgehog launcher, 6 deep bomb launchers and 2 deep bomb slides, can carry up to 70 deep bombs, and are equipped with a new type of anti-submarine sonar. The entire ship is equipped with a large number of electronic equipment, focusing on anti-submarine and air defense, but a dual 550mm torpedo launcher is still installed in the midship to retain a certain amount of counterattack capability against large warships. The whole ship cost less than 1 million US dollars, suitable for rapid production and deployment. At the same time, the French East Asian Fleet Command also requested that a minesweeper be modified on the basis of this ship, torpedoes and some deep bomb launchers were removed, and large minesweeper equipment was modified. We will build a large number of frigates of this class and a small number of fleet special minesweepers in a short time to ensure that our merchant ships can safely pass through the Strait of Malacca."

 ficn.3.d: "For several months now, several captains of civilian ships have been reporting to the colonial government claiming that the Imperial Japanese Navy fleet has been coming too close to them from time to time and has even entered dangerous distances on several occasions, greatly affecting their normal navigation. It is clear that Imperial Japan's power in Southeast Asia is expanding dramatically, and it is safe to say that in the South China Sea, where trade is busy, it will become more and more frequent for the Japanese Navy to flaunt its power to the surrounding countries. Since the establishment of the French Indochina Confederation in 1887, the situation of maritime shipping in France and its Southeast Asian colonies has never been as critical as it is today, and in order to protect our interests, we should perhaps ask for assistance from the French Navy. The Governor of the Colony has just sent a letter to the French Government requesting old battleship conversions and the dispatch of a larger fleet, and proposing a series of orders for new upstarts, 80% of the cost of which could be borne by the Colonial Government."

The French Ministry of Defense has recently delivered to the French Indo-Chinese Finance Department the details of the cost of the new cruisers, and according to the current budget of the French Indo-Chinese Navy, our economic strength will allow one heavy cruiser of the St. Louis class ($40 million) or two light cruisers of the Bayard class to be purchased. "class light cruisers ($60 million). The choice came to the Duke of Richelieu as to whether to use the heavy cruisers to enhance the ability to fight large surface ships or to use the light cruisers to enhance the protection of the main ships and shipping."

The destroyers used by the colonial navy in the past have become too old to provide adequate escort protection for the newer mainships and cruisers. Therefore, the French East Asia Fleet Command planned to order six or seven new large destroyers from the mainland at an estimated cost of $90 million to $105 million. Powerful fighting forces often come at a high price, and despite what we have paid, it won't be long before a force to be reckoned with will be born in the South China Sea. Once war breaks out, the Empire of Japan will have to devote even more resources to maintaining its maritime transportation."

 ficn.9.d: "On a clear morning, the Duke of Richelieu arrived early at the harbor of the naval base at Cam Ranh Bay, where a huge ship was docked alongside the brand-new wharf, with the flag of France fluttering from its tall main mast, imposingly overlooking the diminutive colonial vessels around it. The ship was the Champagne, the newest battleship of the Richelieu class, the fifth ship of the Richelieu class, which Richelieu had been waiting for day and night. The Viceroy had to enlarge the small harbor to create a deep enough berth for the battleship in order to be able to berth her in the French Indochina harbor. Armed with two triple-mounted new 406mm/50 Model 1938 guns (1 in front and 1 in back) and three triple-mounted 152mm/55 Model 1935 guns (2 in front and 1 in back), this mighty battleship was capable of dealing with any of the Japanese Navy's existing ships, even the rumored super-battleships. While the terrific anti-aircraft firepower provided by eight twin 100mm/45 Model 1933 anti-aircraft guns (arranged on both sides of the hull), twelve twin 37mm/70 Model 1935 anti-aircraft guns (arranged on both sides of the forward secondary guns, both sides of the portside, and on both sides of the aft secondary guns), and twenty twin 20mm Erlikon anti-aircraft machine guns (arranged on all sides of the hull) was more than enough to deal with the massive Japanese The guns were guided by the latest search and fire control radar, and were undoubtedly the strongest anti-aircraft defense in their class. As a battleship built specifically for colonial warfare, the Champagne has an impressive range of 15,000 nautical miles / 16 knots, which is why only two main turrets are fitted, to save weight and carry more fuel. French Indo-China paid more than 70 million dollars to the mainland for this advanced battleship. Now that Richelieu is finally getting a flagship worthy of her status, that mighty fleet of broken crossings will soon be no longer a dream."

Now, we finally have a chance to realize one of the early plans for the 'Richelieu' class, which was to use a triple 406mm main gun. Rumor has it that Imperial Japan is secretly building a super battleship with firepower and armor far beyond current standards. The new 406mm/50 Model 1938 guns have greater armor erosion and greater power, actually tested at 20,000 (30,000) meters, eroding 515 (386) mm of horizontal armor and 95 (159) mm of vertical armor, more than enough to deal with potential threats. Due to weight constraints, the new ship was planned to be fitted with two new 406mm main guns, with the secondary guns continuing to use three triple 152mm/55 Model 1935 guns, with the same layout of the main and secondary guns as the 'Gascony'. In order to cope with the threat of a large number of Japanese naval aviation, the new ship focuses on strengthening the anti-aircraft firepower, and is expected to install eight twin 100mm/45 Model 1933 anti-aircraft guns (arranged on both sides of the hull), twelve twin 37mm/70 Model 1935 anti-aircraft guns (arranged on both sides of the forward secondary guns, both sides of the port side, and on both sides of the aft secondary guns), and twenty twin 20mm Erlikon anti-aircraft guns (arranged all over the hull), as well as installing the latest search and fire control radar, the air defense capability is the strongest among the 'Richelieu' class. According to the strategic plan, the ship will be the core force against the enemy surface fleet and serve as the flagship of the entire French Indochina fleet, and the Duke of Richelieu has suggested that it be named 'Champagne'."
