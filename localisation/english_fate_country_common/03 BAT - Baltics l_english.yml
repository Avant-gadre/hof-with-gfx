 BALTIC_end_swedish_neutrality_desc:0 "What the Swedes call neutrality is nothing but weakness; bending to the whims of whichever power seems most powerful at the time with little regard for the wellbeing of the lower classes across their borders. Such a weak-willed and flimsy government is unworthy of sharing our border and we must create a new Sweden with the spine to defend its people from tyranny."
 BALTIC_free_the_workers_of_poland:0 "Free the Workers of Poland"
 BALTIC_free_the_workers_of_poland_desc:0 "Though the Poles once ruled the Baltic, they are now prey vulnerable to the predatory regime of [GER.GetNameDef]. We must defend our comrades in the South and unite them under a Polish Socialist Republic!"
