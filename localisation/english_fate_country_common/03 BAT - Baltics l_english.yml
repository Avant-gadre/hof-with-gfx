 BALTIC_influence_neighbours: "Influence the Neighbours"
 BALTIC_influence_neighbours_desc: "Although not nearly as popular as it was before the wars of independence, the concept of a freed Baltic under socialism is as old as the concept of Baltic self-determination itself.

 BALTIC_end_swedish_neutrality_desc: "What the Swedes call neutrality is nothing but weakness; bending to the whims of whichever power seems most powerful at the time with little regard for the wellbeing of the lower classes across their borders. Such a weak-willed and flimsy government is unworthy of sharing our border and we must create a new Sweden with the spine to defend its people from tyranny."
 BALTIC_free_the_workers_of_poland: "Free the Workers of Poland"
 BALTIC_free_the_workers_of_poland_desc: "Though the Poles once ruled the Baltic, they are now prey vulnerable to the predatory regime of [GER.GetNameDef]. We must defend our comrades in the South and unite them under a Polish Socialist Republic!"
