 SPA_strengthen_kingdom: "Strengthen the Kingdom"
 SPA_strengthen_kingdom_desc: "The Kingdom of Spain is in dire straits, and many believe our nation will soon descend into civil war. We must consolidate our position and endeavour to thwart impending disaster."
 SPA_kings_proclamation: "The Proclamation of the True King"
 SPA_kings_proclamation_desc: "No matter who or what they support, it is always painful for the blood of Spaniards to be spilled. While it seems unlikely at this stage that Javier can be peacefully restored to the throne, a proclamation from the true king declaring the end of Alfonso's reign and urging a peaceful transfer of power may convince some Alfonsists to lay down their arms and help save some Spanish lives from being needlessly lost."
 SPA_army_of_africa: "Recall the Ejército de África"
 SPA_army_of_africa_desc: "The Ejército de África, the Army of Africa, were fundamental to our success in crushing the native rebellion that rose up in the Rif. It seems unlikely that we will face further rebellion in the region in the short term, and so we are presented with the opportunity to recall General Franco's troops back to Cádiz to prepare for any insurrection on the mainland instead."
 SPA_fortify_madrid: "Fortify Madrid"
 SPA_fortify_madrid_desc: "Our capital, here in the heart of Spain, is also our weakest link. It can easily be surrounded, and our enemies know that capturing the Royal Family would ensure we instantly lay down our arms. We cannot allow this to happen, even if it means turning beautiful Madrid into a veritable fortress."
 SPA_defend_burgos: "The Stronghold of Burgos"
 SPA_defend_burgos_desc: "Burgos has been firmly established as the metaphorical stronghold of the Carlist movement, with the government having already lost de facto control of the city. If the Carlist movement is to succeed, Burgos must be transformed into a much less metaphorical stronghold. Defensive positions should be established throughout the city, and even the old castle can be home to anti-air batteries to ensure Javier's ultimate triumph."
 SPA_mil_planning: "Review Our Leadership"
 SPA_mil_planning_desc: "Some might call it a 'purge', but it's very simple - we need to look to the officers who lead our forces, and ensure that those who remain in the higher positions are not secretly loyal to the Carlists or the anarcho-syndicalists. Those who remain must come together and talk of military planning. Let us ensure we have every scenario accounted for before the firing begins."
 SPA_mil_production: "Increase Arms Production"
 SPA_mil_production_desc: "The economy will need to take a back seat to new factories which can produce bombs and guns. These we will need first - the rest can come later."
 SPA_focus_military: "Focus on the Military"
 SPA_focus_military_desc: "The civil war is likely to come, no matter what we do. While it would still be best if we found another way, we must also prepare for the worst - and that means bolstering our military for the coming battles."
 SPA_roads_of_war: "The Roads of War"
 SPA_roads_of_war_desc: "Even during the times of Roman Hispania roads were vital not only to daily life but also to warfare. Without a proper network of roads, and in the modern age railways, supplying and repositioning troops is near impossible. By improving the roads of eastern Spain, we can ensure that any uprising can quickly organise itself into a proper frontline."
 SPA_relocate_factories_seville: "Relocate Industry to the South"
 SPA_relocate_factories_seville_desc: "If things in Spain do truly escalate into civil war, our government stands little chance of holding much north or east of Madrid. It has therefore been proposed that we preemptively move as much industry as we can to Seville, due to it being one of the largest urban areas in the nation and an area that will hopefully be far from the frontlines."
 SPA_repurpose_steel_mills: "Repurpose Steel Mills"
 SPA_repurpose_steel_mills_desc: "Steel mills employ many in our nation and make up a vital part of our economy, however desperate times such as these call for desperate measures. Restructuring a few of the steel mills in southern Spain into more generalised factories may be enough to give us the edge if the ongoing tensions bubble over into full blown conflict, even if it may permanently harm the region's steel industry."
 SPA_new_jobs: "Jobs for the People"
 SPA_new_jobs_desc: "There is so much to be done, but already we have put a great portion of the unemployed back to work. We need to spread the word to the people and reassure them that things are not as dire as they seem. If they only give the kingdom a chance, and time to rebuild, we will prove to them they have made the right choice."
 SPA_civ_production: "New Factories"
 SPA_civ_production_desc: "While state-sponsored factories are never the most efficient, this will be a way for us to get the people working... and for more trade to flow into Spain. Everyone will benefit!"
 SPA_construction_focus: "New Construction"
 SPA_construction_focus_desc: "Economic revitalisation necessitates the construction of new infrastructure and industry alike. By providing jobs to the jobless, perhaps we can distract their political frustrations."
 SPA_zaragozan_steelworks: "Expand Zaragozan Steelworks"
 SPA_zaragozan_steelworks_desc: "Zaragoza is home to some of the largest steelworks in the entire nation, and as a result it is also home to some of the strongest unions in all of Spain. As the city will certainly fall under the control of Syndicalist rebels, investing in an expansion of the steelworks there will greatly aid their potential industrial capacity."
 SPA_focus_economy: "Focus on the Economy"
 SPA_focus_economy_desc: "Spain faces massive unemployment and economic hardship. Until we address these issues, the people will continue to be restless and receptive to revolutionary ideas. To prevent civil war, we should implement comprehensive economic reform."
 SPA_northern_industry: "Industrial Expansions in Northern Spain"
 SPA_northern_industry_desc: "For centuries the stronghold of the Carlist movement has been in the north of Spain. In the event of a civil war, there is no doubt that these territories will remain loyal to the Carlist cause, and any industrial investments in these regions are bound to end up in the hands of their troops."
 SPA_galician_tungsten: "Invest in Galicia"
 SPA_galician_tungsten_desc: "With the situation turning dire, it seems time to already prepare for the inevitable. Galicia's untapped tungsten reserves are plentiful, and is likely to be isolated from any potential conflict within the nation. By focusing on establishing mines to extract this tungsten, vital northern munition factories will be much less restricted by resource constraints."
 SPA_cig: "Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra"
 SPA_cig_desc: "Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra, the War Industries Commission, has been established in Catalonia with the stated purpose of ensuring the country is ready for war. Secretly however, the CIG's real purpose is to militarise the areas of Spain most loyal to CNT-FAI in order to arm these revolutionaries in the event of a civil war."
 SPA_consolidate_spain: "Consolidate Spain"
 SPA_consolidate_spain_desc: "Now is the time to look across the country and see what must be done to pull it together, and to heal the rifts which have formed since the end of the Second Republic."
 SPA_bourbon_throne: "The Borbón Throne"
 SPA_bourbon_throne_desc: "It is time to see that claim enforced and see all of France and Spain united under a single banner once again."
 SPA_franco_spain: "The French Coronation"
 SPA_franco_spain_desc: "As is tradition, and the two nations will be united together under our righteous king."
 SPA_isolation: "We Stand Alone"
 SPA_isolation_desc: "Truly, Spain has no interest in joining in the larger conflicts of the world. We have seen enough troubles. For now, we rebuild and look to our own defence."
 SPA_lease_gibraltar: "Lease Gibraltar"
 SPA_lease_gibraltar_desc: "While we may officially be neutral in the ongoing conflict between French and its Syndicalist rivals, it does not mean we do not wish for a French victory over the godless socialists. The Strait of Gibraltar is vital to controlling the Mediterranean during this war, and by temporarily leasing Gibraltar to the  Frenchs we can help ensure their control over the sea while netting ourselves a tidy sum in the process."
 SPA_putting_refugees_to_work: "Putting the Refugees to Work"
 SPA_putting_refugees_to_work_desc: "The Spanish state is not a charity organisation, if the refugees we have received wish to stay they must make themselves useful. Many of these refugees have industrial backgrounds and will fit perfectly into the workforces of our factories, and for the rest the armed forces always needs more men to ensure the state's protection."
 SPA_influx_of_refugees: "Influx of Refugees"
 SPA_influx_of_refugees_desc: "Being a neutral country in Europe during this great war has resulted in an influx of refugees fleeing their homes and arriving in Spain to be free of conflict. While we of course will not allow unchecked migration into our country, accepting and assimilating these refugees may prove useful in the long run."
 SPA_increased_volunteers: "Unofficial Intervention"
 SPA_increased_volunteers_desc: "Just because we are officially neutral, it does not mean that our private citizens must also be neutral. Many in our country still wish to fight in conflicts overseas, and it would be wrong to stop them from doing so. It is simply coincidental that many of these volunteers happen to be part of our military and are armed with the latest equipment of our armed forces."
 SPA_bounties_of_neutrality: "The Bounties of Neutrality"
 SPA_bounties_of_neutrality_desc: "War is good for business, and even better when you're not involved in it. By sitting on the sidelines of any ongoing conflicts in the world, we are able to conduct trade regardless of allegiances and thus we stand to greatly profit from these conflicts."
 SPA_place_in_the_world: "Our Place in the World"
 SPA_place_in_the_world_desc: "With all the troubles which have afflicted the kingdom, we have come to be treated as a second-class country within Europe - a nation to be ignored, or even one which might be seen as an easy target. Now that we have reasserted our position, it is time to restore our contact with the rest of the world, and to let them know our strength has returned."
 SPA_expanded_european_trade: "Expanded European Trade"
 SPA_expanded_european_trade_desc: "Being part of European means not just access to the French markets, but to all members of the union. Being able to export Spanish goods to large swathes of Europe will greatly stimulate our country's economy."
 SPA_europa_trade: "Renewed French Trade"
 SPA_europa_trade_desc: "Trade with French has greatly diminished since the turmoil of Black Monday hit both our countries. Now that we are properly aligned with the  Frenchs, it is time to renew trade between us, which will greatly aid our country's economic growth."
 SPA_french_equipment: "Request French Equipment"
 SPA_french_equipment_desc: "Ever since the Great War it has been said that French manufactured armaments are unmatched in terms of quality. With our ascension to the Reichspakt, we have the perfect opportunity to request some from our new ally to see for ourselves."
 SPA_french_mining_projects: " French Mining Projects"
 SPA_french_mining_projects_desc: "The French war machine never ceases its thirst for more resources to produce further armaments. French has therefore proposed allowing French led mining projects in our country, to aid in our resource extraction attempts and to hopefully be a mutually beneficial arrangement for us both."
 SPA_french_advisors: "French Advisors"
 SPA_french_advisors_desc: "The years France has spent in exile in Algeria has led to the development of advanced amphibious assault techniques, all in service of reclaiming the mainland. We should ask our French friends to share their knowledge with us, so we too can aid their plans."
 SPA_british_advisors: "British Advisors"
 SPA_british_advisors_desc: "British has been the heart of the Commonwelath in terms of industrial development and military advancement since the loss of the Home Isles. We should seek support from their IEDC and ISAC to aid Spain in our own developments in these fields."
 SPA_iberian_trade: "Iberian Friendship"
 SPA_iberian_trade_desc: "For centuries the fate of Spain and Portugal have been closely intertwined. Now that we have both united together in the common Entente cause, we should use it as an opportunity to expand trade with our dear neighbour."
 SPA_guard_border: "Guard the Borders"
 SPA_guard_border_desc: "The many paths over the Pyrenees are our only weakness. We must fortify the border, to ensure no-one pushes into Spanish territory while we can yet defend it."
 SPA_rebuilding_the_economy: "Rebuilding the Economy"
 SPA_rebuilding_the_economy_desc: "The economy of Spain has been completely destroyed by our recent troubles. Now that the situation has stabilised, it is now time for us to rebuild."
 SPA_spanish_miracle: "Spanish Miracle"
 SPA_spanish_miracle_desc: "At long last the Spanish economy has been rebuilt. Throughout Spain, the people are hard at work while also enjoying the newfound economic prosperity throughout the realm."
 SPA_catholic_trade_unions: "Catholic Trade Unions"
 SPA_catholic_trade_unions_desc: "Trade unions are unfortunately rather important in the modern economy, and we cannot simply get rid of them completely. However instead of alienating them we should instead promote Catholic trade unions as an alternative. This will help give us greater control over the working classes as well as help deradicalise the unions that sided with the godless syndicalists."
 SPA_labour_charter: "Labour Charter"
 SPA_labour_charter_desc: "The state has announced the creation of a Labour Charter. This charter helps protect the realm's subjects from godless Syndicalism by providing a conservative welfare programme and recognising some worker's rights, nipping the growth of further Syndicalism in the bud."
 SPA_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
 SPA_modern_agriculture_desc: "The many small farm estates of the countryside have struggled during the recent troubles we have faced, as they have been unable to adopt new agricultural technologies and methods of cultivation. We should subsidise the import of modern agricultural equipment to jump start this process."
 SPA_military_factories: "Expand the Arms Industry"
 SPA_military_factories_desc: "War will likely come to Spain in the future. The godless Commune of France sits just across the Pyrenees after all. Thus in order to prepare for that future war, we should build new military factories."
 SPA_industrial_nationalisation: "Industrial Nationalisation"
 SPA_industrial_nationalisation_desc: "While our government has often supported free market industrial endeavours, the nationalisation of key industry during this turbulent time of reconstruction may significantly aid the rebuilding process and should be considered. The question of if and how we should return the industry to the original owners after this period of nationalisation is simply one for a future time, preferably far enough that it no longer matters."
 SPA_create_ini: "Instituto Nacional de Industria"
 SPA_create_ini_desc: "The Instituto Nacional de Industria or National Institute of Industry, is a state run corporation created to help develop the Spanish economy and improve the state's self-sufficiency."
 SPA_expand_royal_academia: "Expand Royal Academia"
 SPA_expand_royal_academia_desc: "The Royal Academies are the highest education schools within Spain. Many often specialise in one particular field or connected fields, such as science, medicine, history, language and so on. We should make sure that they get the funding needed to provide education for Spain."
 SPA_ley_general_educacion: "Ley General de Educación"
 SPA_ley_general_educacion_desc: "In order to improve the quality of education for Spaniards across the country, a new law has been passed. The law modernises the education system, as well as making attendance mandatory for all Spaniards for at least 14 years. This will vastly improve the quality of education in Spain."
 SPA_electrification_program: "Electrification Programme"
 SPA_electrification_program_desc: "In order to help improve the economy we should look at electrify the country of Spain. This shall have over time beneficial impacts for the Spanish economy."
 SPA_comercial_investment: "Commercial Subsidies"
 SPA_comercial_investment_desc: "The many private companies that are at the heart of the Spanish economy have been torn apart and left in ruins following both Black Monday and the Civil War. By providing government subsidies to these businesses we can ensure they get back on their feet and bring back the jobs our people so desperately need"
 SPA_military_investments: "Military Investments"
 SPA_military_investments_desc: "We should have military companies invest in the various provinces. Not only will this help provide jobs for the King's subjects but it will also help the military production for the future wars."
 SPA_provincial_rebuilding: "Provincial Rebuilding"
 SPA_provincial_rebuilding_desc: "We should look at rebuilding the various provinces and let their economy improve and recover."
 SPA_resource_extraction: "Extract Natural Resources"
 SPA_resource_extraction_desc: "Spain has an abundance of minerals that can be exploited. We should survey the land for new deposits and export these minerals abroad. Of particular interest is Galician tungsten. There is great potential to be found there."
 SPA_expand_railroads: "Expand the Railroads"
 SPA_expand_railroads_desc: "Railroads have been one of the main sources of infrastructure for Spain since their introduction in the last century. As we rebuild the economy, we should rebuild and modernise the Spanish railroads."
 SPA_replace_alfonso: "Future of the Nation"
 SPA_replace_alfonso_desc: "Our King Alfonso is in a coma, and it seems likely his time will soon be at its end. A regent is not enough - we must decide who is to lead Spain in the years to come."

 SPA_settle_the_succession_question_desc: "Placeholder"
 SPA_call_for_unity: "Royal Unity"
 SPA_call_for_unity_desc: "Throughout this period of healing and reconcillation our nation has had to go through, our King has acted as a uniting beacon of stability. No matter the political changes or disagreements we experience, [SPR.getleader] and his successors will always be with us to guide our nation forward."
 SPA_reconcilliation: "Integrate Alfonsist Remnants"
 SPA_reconcilliation_desc: "Though misguided in their struggle against us, the Alfonsists have far more in common with us than the anarchists. With our shared beliefs in God, King and Country, it will not be difficult to ally them and bring peace to this troubled land."
 SPA_national_catholicism: "National Catholicism"
 SPA_national_catholicism_desc: "The rules and teachings of the Catholic church will be an integral part of Spanish Law. The church will have pride of place in making the laws while [SPK.getleader] will make sure that the church is protected."
 SPA_arrest_leaders: "Arrest the Malcontents"
 SPA_arrest_leaders_desc: "We will never have true peace while radicals are free to foment discord. While they will certainly do their best to rise up, their time is done and they know it. We must capture the worst of the leaders and put them away - this is the path to lasting unity for Spain."
 SPA_corporate_state: "A Corporate State"
 SPA_corporate_state_desc: "Society will be centred around the natural bodies of association: the family, where one is born; the municipality, where one lives; the union, where one works. The exercise of any individual right is conditioned to the decisions made by these traditional social corporations while issues relating to religion will be handled by ecclesiastical organisations."
 SPA_abolish_parties: "Corporatise the Cortes"
 SPA_abolish_parties_desc: "Following a corporate model, the Cortes will be closed, with the National Consultative Assembly standing in their place. A fruitful evolutionary process will begin that will allow the transformation of national public life, creating a corporate and authoritarian State. The parliamentary system in its current form is a failure, and so a Supreme National Assembly is required to build a New Spain."
 SPA_national_revolution: "National Revolution"
 SPA_national_revolution_desc: "The Patriotic Union will bring forth a new order, sweeping away any vestiges of previous failed regimes. To implement it necessitates a national revolution with direct, fiery and combative action. Life is a militia and must be lived with a pure spirit of service and sacrifice in order to regenerate the damaged Spanish nation."
 SPA_municipal_reorg: "Municipal Reorganisation"
 SPA_municipal_reorg_desc: "Carrying on from the Municipal Statute of 1924, José Calvo Sotelo has proposed further reorganisation of municipalities in order to finally regenerate municipal and political life and vanquish the plague of caciquismo. Provincial and local authorities will be replaced by trusted men to ensure that no forms of corruption will exist."

 SPA_charter_of_labour: "Fuero del Trabajo"
 SPA_charter_of_labour_desc: "A Charter of Labour will be drafted to resolve the issues caused by labour disputes and revolutionary unions. It's provisions will include the prohibition of strikes, the regulation of working hours and of rest, the creation of the Magistracy of Labour and the creation of the Spanish Trade Union Organisation as a sole trade union, which will group employers and workers equally, both subordinated to the decisions of the State."
 SPA_unity_at_last: "A National Movement"
 SPA_unity_at_last_desc: "We must aim to be a movement above petty party politics that any true Spaniard can rally behind. The Liberals, Marxists and Freemasons dare to threaten our great nation but they shall never succeed, for we have our Catholic faith beside us and once Spain has been united, the world will know that we are whole and not to be trifled with."
 SPA_new_constitution: "Absorb the Carlists"
 SPA_new_constitution_desc: "Though misguided in their struggle against us, the Carlists have far more in common with us than the anarchists. With our shared beliefs in God, Family and Country, it will not be difficult to ally them and bring peace to this troubled land."
 SPA_jan: "Rally the JAN"
 SPA_jan_desc: "The Juventudes de Acción Nacional are the youth wing of our party and have captured the boundless energy hidden within the Spanish youth, which is far different to the desolate and enervating scepticism of our defeatists and intellectuals. The JAN faithfully came to the aid of Spain during the civil war by recruiting many volunteers for our holy cause. Now that the war is over, the JAN should be expanded and provide a home for all of our society's young."
 SPA_spanish_man: "The New Spanish Man"
 SPA_spanish_man_desc: "The anarchic generation of 98 and their ideas have created a sad, harsh and vinegary Spanish youth. We shall forge new men: an authentic, happy, optimistic, Spanish youth unlike the current that is riddled with defeatism and lacking in vision."
 SPA_organic_democracy: "Organic Democracy"
 SPA_organic_democracy_desc: "Instead of petty things like liberal principles, parliamentarism, political parties, and universal suffrage, Spanish Democracy will be based on natural social institutions such as the Family or Municipality, ensuring that Party Politics will cease to corrupt the Spanish people. A bicameral system will be created: Legislative power will be exercised by a Congress elected by universal suffrage  and by a Senate representing organised social interests."
 SPA_rights_spanish: "Restore the Rights of the Spanish"
 SPA_rights_spanish_desc: "Since Primo de Rivera's coup in 1923, the Spanish Constitution has remained suspended, which evidently has not mended the rifts in Spanish society as shown by the outbreak of civil war. Therefore the Spanish Constitution will be restored and the fundamental rights of the Spanish will be recognised, so long as the exercise of these rights does not go against the spiritual, national and social unity of Spain."
 SPA_rebuild_command: "Rebuild Our National Command"
 SPA_rebuild_command_desc: "Our command structures have been devastated. Now is the time to rebuild them anew, to cast aside old and outdated ways of thinking and to embrace the new."

 SPA_academia_basica_del_aire: "Academia Básica del Aire"
 SPA_academia_basica_del_aire_desc: "Modern wars are fought not only on the land and across the seas, but also in the skies. Modern air doctrines must be instilled into our pilots, and state of the art planes must be built if we expect to be victorious in our battles."
 SPA_rule_the_skies: "Champions of the Skies"
 SPA_rule_the_skies_desc: "The air force is no longer a rag-tag collection of volunteers, but a fully functioning organ of our military. Let us rule the skies of Spain and beyond!"
 SPA_colonial_air_ports: "Colonial Airports"
 SPA_colonial_air_ports_desc: "We should expand our airports within our colonies. This shall allow the air force to quickly go from the mainland to our overseas colonies to defend them from anyone who would seek to separate us from our possessions."
 SPA_voice_of_heaven: "Eyes of Heaven"
 SPA_voice_of_heaven_desc: "Radar is a promising new technology which, with further development could provide a wealth of information about enemy tactics and positions and reveal the course of enemy aircraft. Several pilots have begun calling radar the Eyes of Heaven for how much they are able to reveal and see."
 SPA_foreign_airplanes: "Purchase Foreign Planes"
 SPA_foreign_airplanes_desc: "Our country is not really in the position to manufacture an air force. For this reason, we must purchase old planes from abroad to help kickstart the Spanish Air Force. The air war is likely to become of greater importance as the Weltkrieg had suggested decades ago."
 SPA_bombers: "Bomber Effort"
 SPA_bombers_desc: "To truly assist the army, our air force must be capable of destroying fortified positions and disrupting enemy infrastructure. To accomplish this, we should focus on the development of new tactical and strategic bombers."
 SPA_army_air_support: "Army Air Support"
 SPA_army_air_support_desc: "The easiest enemy to fight is one who has already been killed by a bombing run before the battle begins, and so our air force should be focused on producing planes focused on battlefield support missions and bombing efforts to support our troops in their endeavours."
 SPA_fighters: "Fighter Effort"
 SPA_fighters_desc: "Fighters are the backbone of any air force, allowing us to express our supremacy over the sky and allow the rest of our air force to flourish. To ensure that we are able to do so, we must focus on developing new fighter models to outperform our enemies in the air."
 SPA_upgrade_air_ports: "Nationalise Civilian Aerodromes"
 SPA_upgrade_air_ports_desc: "The infrastructure needed to support a large air force does not need to be built completely from the ground up. Across the country there are many civilian aerodromes which we would be able to nationalise and expand into proper military airports, saving us significant time in establishing new airfields for our pilots to use."
 SPA_air_supremacy: "Air Supremacy"
 SPA_air_supremacy_desc: "The skies must be free from enemies and our armies unmolested by hostile aircraft. Our air force should primarily be focused on establishing and maintaining control of the air."
 SPA_aviation_industry: "Support the Aviation Industry"
 SPA_aviation_industry_desc: "Spanish aircraft manufacturers have been stunted by the turbulence that has plagued the country for several years. Ongoing troubles in the world have showed the need for modern aircraft companies, and so support should be provided to several Spanish companies that seek to modernise our aviation industry."
 SPA_new_pilots: "Training New Pilots"
 SPA_new_pilots_desc: "Most of our current air force is made up of eager volunteers and former pilots of civilian aircraft, with little to no knowledge of military aviation. It is therefore imperative that these recruits receive proper training before they are deployed in the skies, as their experience will hopefully give us the edge we need over our rivals."
 SPA_paratrooper_focus: "Desperta Ferro!"
 SPA_paratrooper_focus_desc: "By the end of the Middle Ages, a famous company of Aragonese mercenaries, the Almogávares, made their war cry “Awake the Iron” famous across the Mediterranean. That war cry will honour a new unit of paratroopers; quick infantry, transported by planes and able to deploy behind enemy lines."
 SPA_armada_espanola: "Armada Española"
 SPA_armada_espanola_desc: "During the Spanish golden age, the Spanish Armada was the greatest fleet in the world. Its ship sailed the oceans and we ruled the waves. We should modernise our fleet and restore our navy to its former glory."

 SPA_cruiser_support: "Light Cruiser Support"
 SPA_cruiser_support_desc: "The use of smaller, more lightly armoured scout ships will allow us to disperse forces across a wide area in order to scout our entire coastline, ensuring we are able to rapidly respond to enemy incursions."
 SPA_coast_guard: "Establish a Dedicated Coast Guard"
 SPA_coast_guard_desc: "Currently Spain lacks any form of dedicated coast guard force, with most of the duties being handled by the Guardia Civil until recently. If we are to fully protect the Spanish coast from any possible threats, it would be imperative for us to establish a dedicated coast guard unit to handle these duties instead."
 SPA_defend_the_coast: "Guardians of the Spanish Coast"

 SPA_modern_galleons: "Modern Galleons"
 SPA_modern_galleons_desc: "The great galleons of Spain were the strongest ships of their age. Likewise as we build up and modernise our navy we should build modern battleships and dreadnoughts to secure the seas once again."
 SPA_grand_navy: "The New Armada"

 SPA_infanteria_de_marina_desc: "The Infantería de Marina is the marine force of the Spanish Navy and the oldest marine corp in the world, having been founded in 1537 by Charles I of Spain. While the Infantería de Marina has slowly lost most of its prestige as the years have gone by, under [SPA.GetLeader] things will be different. Our marines shall be once again restored to a status truly befitting their legacy."
 SPA_new_generation_of_admirals: "Training a New Generation of Admirals"
 SPA_new_generation_of_admirals_desc: "In order to rebuild our great navy, efforts must be made to modernise our admiralty. Our admirals, both new and old, must be taught modern doctrines for a modern age."
 SPA_upgrade_dockyards: "Dirección General de la Marina Mercante"
 SPA_upgrade_dockyards_desc: "The Spanish Navy was famous for its merchants, Spanish galleons filled with gold and other goods from the Americas would flow back daily to the mainland. We should rekindle our mercantile spirit and build a modern merchant marine for the Spanish Navy."
 SPA_a_modern_army: "A Modern Army"
 SPA_a_modern_army_desc: "It was not long ago that our army was hopelessly outdated, barely advancing since the Napoleonic Wars. Now with our recent reforms and technological advancements the Spanish army can no longer be discounted as an outdated relic, being now a modern army that may soon become the premier army of Europe."
 SPA_tank_shipments: "Request French Tank Shipments"
 SPA_tank_shipments_desc: "If we are to win this ongoing war, we will need as many tanks as possible deployed to the battlefield. While they may not be the highest quality, the  Frenchs still have a large amount of old tanks rusting away in their stockpiles. By petitioning Berlin, we may be able to quickly get a sizable amount of these tanks delivered, allowing us to quickly send them to the frontlines."
 SPA_navarran_lancers: "Navarran Lancers"
 SPA_navarran_lancers_desc: "During the first Carlist War, the lancers from Navarra were some of the best cavalry troops that the armies had. It therefore seems fitting to revive this legacy with our tank brigades. They shall be our elite troops, and the tip of the spear of the Spanish Army."
 SPA_weltrieg_lessons: "Armoured Warfare Tactics"
 SPA_weltrieg_lessons_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed to everybody the potential use of tanks. Combined with motorised or mechanised support, tanks can excel at the purpose they were designed to achieve; to catch the enemy by surprise. Unlike in the Weltkrieg, where tanks were massive and vulnerable targets, a much more mobile approach is needed."
 SPA_mechanized_effort: "Spanish Auto Industry"
 SPA_mechanized_effort_desc: "We should look at modernising the Automotive industry of the Spanish Army. Mechanised warfare will require better trucks and automobiles, which will help in getting supplies to our troops as well as increasing the mobility of our soldiers."
 SPA_army_of_maneuver: "Army of Manoeuvre"
 SPA_army_of_maneuver_desc: "It is no longer the Weltkrieg, wars cannot be easily won by simply having a large cannon. Motorised divisions, tank brigades, and fast moving infantry are key to victory, and so they will be key to the armies of Spain."
 SPA_militarise_the_railways: "Militarise the Railways"
 SPA_militarise_the_railways_desc: "Supply lines are the arteries of an army, and trains their blood. In order to properly supply our troops, we must take steps to militarise the existing rail network and ensure it is optimised for war."
 SPA_adaptive_fortifications: "Adaptive Fortifications"
 SPA_adaptive_fortifications_desc: "The opportunity to build grand protective fortifications is not one often granted to us, instead our soldiers must learn how to quickly produce more adaptive forms of fortifications to protect themselves."
 SPA_defenders_of_realm: "Defenders of the Realm"
 SPA_defenders_of_realm_desc: "The battles that decide our future will not be fought in the open fields, but in the centre of great cities and sprawling urban landscapes. In order to defend our realm, our soldiers must learn how to fight in the streets, across rooftops, and even inside occupied homes."
 SPA_emergency_factories: "Emergency Armament Production"
 SPA_emergency_factories_desc: "In times of peace we can afford to enforce safety standards and protections in our factories, but we no longer have this luxury. While some of those working in our factories may be injured, or potentially give their lives in service of the cause, it is a sacrifice we have to endure."

 SPA_guardia_civil: "Guardia Civil"
 SPA_guardia_civil_desc: "The Guardia Civil is the gendarme of the Spanish government and it has a military role in protecting the country. We should strengthen the Guardia Civil and provide them with better military training to be one of the backbones of the new Spanish army."
 SPA_artillery_effort: "Modern Guns for Modern Soldiers"
 SPA_artillery_effort_desc: "The world is quickly moving past the age of bolt action and small capacity semi-automatic rifles, and yet many of our frontline infantry are still equipped with this old fashioned equipment. If we are to be victorious we must focus on modernising and updating our infantry equipment and artillery, lest we wish for our army to languish in the past forever."
 SPA_preservation_of_order: "Preservation of Order"
 SPA_preservation_of_order_desc: "A loyal army is fundamental to maintaining order in the state. Without one, anarchy and chaos is sure to prevail against order, and so we must therefore take steps to ensure and encourage loyalty in the army."
 SPA_modern_terrico: "Reorganise the Infantry"
 SPA_modern_terrico_desc: "While armoured warfare has its place, the backbone of every major army will always remain the humble footsoldier. Our infantry brigades will be reorganised and modernised into an elite fighting force, able to see off anyone who dares to challenge it."
 SPA_portuguese_aid: "Aid From Our Iberian Brothers"
 SPA_portuguese_aid_desc: "No matter how much we fight or bicker, the peoples of Spain and Portugal are truly brothers and sisters. While the Portuguese government does not yet wish to officially recognise Javier as the king of Spain, those in charge of the Portuguese regime and many subjects of its realm wish to aid the rightful Carlist cause. If we petition our Portuguese friends for support, there is no doubt that they will provide to us as much as they possibly can."
 SPA_german_assistance: " French Material Support"
 SPA_german_assistance_desc: "While the Spanish army may lack in tank divisions, our friends in Berlin lead the world in tank production and development. By petitioning the  Frenchs to provide direct material support in the form of heavy tanks, we stand to have a significant technological advantage over the rebels, which will certainly aid us in restoring order in the realm."
