 RomaniaCore.1.d: "Victory to Romania! Decades of humiliation have been swept away, Transylvania is back in the arms of the Romanian motherland, His Majesty Vlad III has recovered his homeland, and all his Romanian-speaking countrymen are once again united under the tricolor flag. So why not hold a feast to celebrate this great victory? The king decided to celebrate this victory with a great banquet in Cluj-Napoca, the capital of Northern Transylvania. In addition to the leaders of the National Renaissance Front, Miss Scarlet, Mr. Darnic Prestone and the head of the Iron Guard, Codreanu, were invited to the banquet to celebrate together the return of their homeland and the reunification of Romania."
 RomaniaCore.1.a: "The scene is bound to be very lively, isn't it?" 
 
 RomaniaCore.2.t: "Day one: celebrating reunification!"
 RomaniaCore.2.d: "In the Great War, Romania won the war at the cost of almost dying. But Hungary refused to implement the resolutions of the Allies. While the Romanians fought to recover their rightful territory, the Allies abandoned us midway! But these twenty years of lying in wait were not in vain. The Hungarian rulers have been driven out, the Romanian tricolor has flown in the Carpathian Mountains, and the efforts of the people have not been in vain. Now, the delegates will toast to the future of Romania! In the next few days, the delegates will discuss the guidelines on various post-war matters."
 RomaniaCore.2.a: "Cheers!" 
 
 RomaniaCore.3.t: "Day 2: the Magyar issue"
 RomaniaCore.3.d: "Although Transylvania is undoubtedly a sacred and inseparable territory of Romania, we should also note that there are many Magyar people in Northern Transylvania, and these Magyar people have resisted very strongly in the war, some of them are fanatical Arrow Crossers. The hardest resistance has been suppressed by us, but there are still many people who are very unhappy with our local government. We have had to adopt a policy approach that defines our approach to the Mazars to ensure that our dominance in this area will last."
 RomaniaCore.3.a: "They have to learn to be Romanians" 
 RomaniaCore.3.b: "They are only worthy of being second-class citizens" 
 
 RomaniaCore.4.t: "Day 3: Communist problem"
 RomaniaCore.4.d: "The Red Menace in Romania has been almost wiped out by us, and the remaining Romanian Communists have gone underground, not daring to fight the government openly. But communist activity was so rampant in Hungary that we encountered strong resistance from communist forces in several locations as we crossed the Carpathian Mountains. Both the National Renewal Front politicians and the Iron Guard Corps strongly advocated the internment or execution of the Red bandits, although Darnic Preston believed that all captured Communists could be deported back to Hungary in order to undermine the Hungarian political situation."
 RomaniaCore.4.a: "Arrest them all" 
 RomaniaCore.4.b: "Pack them up and send them to the Magyars" 
 
 RomaniaCore.5.t: "Day 4: German Issue"
 RomaniaCore.5.d: "There is already definite information indicating that Germany supported Hungary in this war. Although German assistance was mainly concentrated in the Germanic settlement of Banat, assistance to the regular Hungarian army was limited to some military forces. Advisors, they still pose a major threat to us. Fortunately, the German side did not publicly support Hungary, and now, when we have already won, the Germans may change their attitude. We can follow Darnic’s advice and pretend not to Knowing Germany’s support for Hungary, turned to prove to Germany that we are a stronger and more reliable ally. But King Vlad did not trust the Germans, thinking that Germany was trying to control Hungary in the process of supporting Hungary, even if it could win Germany is an ally and Romania is in danger of being controlled by Germany. Miss Scarlet’s staff also strongly opposes Germany, believing that Germany’s evil popularism will eventually swallow us."
 RomaniaCore.5.a: "We want to keep our distance from Germany"
 RomaniaCore.5.b: "Dannick convinced most people"
 
 RomaniaCore.6.t: "Danick's Rebellion"
 RomaniaCore.6.d: "As a Nordic immigrant, it is difficult to think that Danic Press really loves this young country. In fact, Romania is just a test field for Danic in his political and speculative career. , And his real stage is still in Berlin, a hundred miles away. Dannick has realized that it is almost impossible for him to continue to control this country with the help of Germany. But Dannick is not willing to give up his position in Romania easily. He wants to become a true leader, a person who controls everything, a person who is not swayed by any forces and groups. In this case, he seems to have only one choice left..."

 RomaniaCore.7.t: "The arrival of a new era"
 RomaniaCore.7.d: "The contradiction between the king and the Iron Guard has now eased. In the battle of the Carpathians, the Iron Guard has proven its loyalty to this country. Compared to the glib politicians and A French-speaking elite, Vlad III is more willing to believe in the Iron Guards rooted in Romanian soil. For Konoriu Codreanu, the head of the Iron Guards, Vlad III is in his eyes to be able to unite and live together. The holy monarch who leads the entire country. Because Romania’s domestic political situation has made the opposition lose most of its power, no one can stop Vlad III from appointing the first cabinet led by members of the Iron Guard. A whole new era is already here. arrival!"
 RomaniaCore.7.a: "Look into the future"
 
 ROM_Legionary_Kingdom_will_be_unlocked_tt: "§YKingdom of Legion§! Route will be unlocked"
 
 RomaniaCore.8.t: "Bomb Attack"
 RomaniaCore.8.d: "It is naturally unwise to fight directly against Vlad III and his minions, the Iron Guard members. Dannick knows very well that even if he is very powerful in this country, he cannot fight at the same time. The king and the Iron Guard are enemies. The best way is undoubtedly to defeat them one by one. Danic’s plan is simple. On the last day of the celebration, a bomb attack was carried out on Vlad himself and preemptively took over the police department and the army. Begin to search for the Iron Guards under the pretext of "King Killing". There is no doubt that the realization of this plan depends on the success of the attack and whether Dane can win the trust of the army in time."
 RomaniaCore.8.a: "The attack was successful, and Danic began to hunt the Iron Guards"
 RomaniaCore.8.b: "The attack failed, Danick absconded"
 RomaniaCore.8.c: "The attack was successful, but Darnic's conspiracy was revealed"
 
 RomaniaCore.9.t: "Cleaning the Iron Guard"
 RomaniaCore.9.d: "It succeeded! After successfully killing Vlad III with a bomb, Danic Press succeeded in persuading the police department to accept his "command." But the Iron Guard moved. Also very quickly, Codreanu organized Iron Guard members to occupy the main road of Cluj-Napoca and set up roadblocks on the main road. A large number of Iron Guard members came out from the "lair" holding weapons and occupied It is located in the suburban railway station, and Horia Simma is organizing more local Iron Guard militants to come for reinforcements. Although some leaders of the National Reconstruction Front have recognized the authority of Dannick as the "temporary leader", he The power he can mobilize is very limited. If he can't defeat the Iron Guard here, his plan will fail."
 RomaniaCore.9.a: "Send assassins to assassinate Codreanu"
 RomaniaCore.9.b: "Take a telegram to General Antonescu"
 
 RomaniaCore.10.t: "Assassination of Codreanu"
 RomaniaCore.10.d: "Darnic Prestone’s most powerful assassin group "Zugzwang" has been preparing for this day for a long time. The Iron Guard has strict internal discipline, and Darnic’s eyeliner can’t help it. Understand the high-level intelligence, but according to the existing intelligence, Darnice marked the most frequent "lairs" of Codreanu on the map. The target of the attack has been reduced to less than 5. Now, Darnic has not only gambled again. There is no other choice other than a handful. Now he has decided to dispatch these assassins who have received the most rigorous training to assassinate this responsive commander of the Iron Guard."
 RomaniaCore.10.a: "The assassination was successful, and Sima took over as the head of Iron Guard"
 RomaniaCore.10.b: "The Assassin made a big shot, and the Iron Guard contacted Antonescu"
 
 RomaniaCore.11.t: "Retaliation"
 RomaniaCore.11.d: "The assassination of the leader Codreanu by the Yggdmillennias has provoked an outcry within the Iron Guard. Despite the de facto paralysis of the Iron Guard's chain of command, Horia Sima and the "Green Shirt Prince" Cantacuzino decided to launch a retaliatory assassination against Darnic, whose killing would mean the complete victory of the Iron Guard in this struggle, since Darnic was the initiator and the only one who knew everything about the incident. victory. The Iron Guard daredevils are ready to avenge their leader and take over their future."
 RomaniaCore.11.a: "Darnic was wounded and forced to flee" 
 RomaniaCore.11.b: "Darnic took hold of the situation" 
 
 RomaniaCore.12.t: "Antonescu coup"
 RomaniaCore.12.d: "The entire Yggdmillennia family did not expect that Antonescu, a general who seemed to be loyal to the king, would be a sympathizer of Codreanu. Upon receiving the telegram, Antonescu decisively commanded his direct troops to occupy Bucharest, declared a state of emergency and proclaimed Corneliu Zelea Codreanu as the Prime Minister and "emergency leader" of Romania. Now that Darnic was held by the Iron Guard in Transylvania and Bucharest was occupied by Antonescu, he knew very well that he was powerless to return. However, the fact that General Antonescu has expressed his attitude is not enough to determine the current situation, after all, the army is in chaos and it is still uncertain whether the Iron Guard will take power."
 RomaniaCore.12.a: "Coup succeeds, Darnic goes into exile" 
 RomaniaCore.12.b: "General Senătescu and Forvedge thwarted the coup" 
 
 RomaniaCore.13.t: "Darnic escapes"
 RomaniaCore.13.d: "Darnic survives an unusually violent attack by the Iron Guard, but he is no longer able to establish himself in Transylvania. With the "interim leader" no longer able to carry out his duties, the entire government and the FNRG politicians without a head, and the Bucharest parliament dazed and confused as to what is happening, the country is now like a small boat spinning in a huge wave, threatening to capsize."
 RomaniaCore.13.a: "The Iron Guard has taken over the government" 
 RomaniaCore.13.b: "General Senătescu and Forvedge stabilized the situation" 
 
 RomaniaCore.14.t: "The victory of the Yggdmillennia"
 RomaniaCore.14.d: "Darnic Preston has defeated all his enemies: the king, the Iron Guard, and the dissidents in the government. The Iron Guard, which lost its leader, was soon broken in the chaos by the police and the army loyal to the Yggdmillennia, and the leaders of the Iron Guard have fled. Now that Darnic's hard work in this political testing ground has finally paid off, and he has taken the highest power in the country, it is time to start his personal ambitions and those of the entire Yggdmillennia family. Soon, Thousand Realms Tree personnel will take up positions in all branches of the government, and a new order belonging to Darnic has arrived."
 RomaniaCore.14.a: "Darnic, great!" 
 
 RomaniaCore.15.t: "The victory of Sima"
 RomaniaCore.15.d: "The loss of the chief, Codreanu, was a great and irreparable loss for the Iron Guards. But the sacrifice of the chief has not been in vain, the king's minions and saboteurs have been eradicated from the band, the state traitor Darnic has fled the country, and Horia Sima, who is in charge of the Iron Guard in Transylvania, has reaped a double victory: the unification of the homeland and the complete political dominance of the Iron Guard. The Archangel Michael is watching us, the Head of Codreanu is with us, and the Iron Guard will bring lasting strength, security and prosperity to Romania!"
 RomaniaCore.15.a: "Hail!" 
 
 RomaniaCore.16.t: "Democracy strikes back!"
 RomaniaCore.16.d: "As General Senătescu's army marched into Bucharest, the Iron Guard elements, Darnic's cronies, and other rebel forces were routed. General Senătescu announced Fiore Forvedge as the new Prime Minister of Romania. From her wheelchair, Forvedge made a radio address to the terrified population of Bucharest to ease their fears. With the king's authoritarian rule, the Iron Guard's totalitarian rebellion and Darnic's conspiracy disintegrating in mutual conflagration, it was time to restore parliamentary politics to the country. Forvedge promised that elections to the Bucharest City Council as well as to the National Assembly would begin within a month."

 RomaniaCore.17.t: "Căpitanul Triumph"
 RomaniaCore.17.d: "All arrests and sabotage campaigns against the Iron Guard have ended in failure, and the Iron Guard has survived under the leadership of its leader, Codreanu. The king's minions and the conspirators in the court have been eliminated, the opposition has lost its political base, and now it is time for the true representatives of the Romanian people, the Archangel Michael's Legion, to rule the country. After hurrying back to Bucharest, Codreanu, surrounded by the fanatical Iron Guard regiment, made a speech announcing the beginning of the full rise of Romania. However, Codreanu said that the country still needed a king, and he already knew who the candidate would be."
 RomaniaCore.17.a: "The chief is immortalized!"
 
 RomaniaCore.18.t: "Coronation of Flandre"
 RomaniaCore.18.d: "When Codreanu announced that Remilia Scarlet's sister, Flandre Scarlet, had not died in 1918, as rumored, the nation was in shock and in a state of debate. In fact, Frandolou had been in the service of the Iron Guard and had lurked in Transylvania for more than a decade, organizing most of its activities in Transylvania with the support of Horia Sima. Codreanu declared that Flandre had inherited not only the lineage of Flanders III, but also his valor and courage, and was a worthy successor to the king. In her first public speech, Flandre, whose coronation took place at the Bucharest Palace, declared that, unlike her "cowardly sister", she would not fail the Romanian people and that she would work with the Iron Guard to bring recovery and prosperity to Romania and would not hesitate to destroy Romania's enemies."
 RomaniaCore.18.a: "Long live Her Majesty Flandre!"
 
 RomaniaCore.19.t: "The new head of the regiment, Flandre"
 RomaniaCore.19.d: "Almost every member of the Iron Guard in Transylvania knows that at the top of the regiment, there is a female leader codenamed "Levatine" who directs all the activities of the Iron Guard in Transylvania, but few people can see her real face. Now, the Iron Guard has cleared all the obstacles in front of it, and the leader, Codreanu, has died with honor for this victory. Sima and Cantacuzino decided that it was time to reveal the fact that "Levatine" was the second lady of the Scarlet family, Frandolou, and to elect Frandolou as the new leader. Dressed in a green gown, Flandre gave her first speech to all Iron Guard members. She declared that the Iron Guard had been the mainstay of the Carpathian campaign and praised Codreanu for his service and sacrifice for the Iron Guard and the country. \n\n "Comrades, we are here to tell you that the Iron Guard regiment has not disintegrated because of setbacks. Captain Codreanu has sacrificed his life for the cause of the Iron Guard, and he dedicated his life to his country. He fulfilled his ultimate task as a member of the Iron Guard regiment, which was to die for the country and to destroy our enemies. Now, in the presence of Comrade Sima and Comrade Cantacuzino, I, Frandolou Scarlet, officially succeed as the new head of the Iron Guard Corps. King Vlad has passed away, and Remilia's cowardice has convinced us that, despite the role of the monarch that the head of Codreanu has always emphasized, a weak monarchy can no longer save this country. We will make this country a complete Iron Guard country, a country that belongs entirely to the Romanian people. We will make our enemies realize that the sword of the Archangel Michael is still sharp. Comrades, our souls are hungry for revenge, and the union with death does not scare us, because we know that the sacrifice of each regiment is for our ultimate victory!""
 RomaniaCore.19.a: "We leave the enemy with nothing but death!"
 
 RomaniaCore.20.t: "Bucharest is in a standoff"
 RomaniaCore.20.d: "With the murder of the old King Vlad III by conspirators, Romanian politics is thrown into chaos. Attempts by politicians around the king to maintain a provisional government and defeat the Iron Guard have failed. Today, a part of the population believes that the orthodoxy of the government can only be maintained by having Remilia Scarlet crowned as soon as possible according to the law of succession. Intelligence Bureau official and Remilia's confidant, Izayoi Sakuyaa, has now pre-emptively seized Bucharest, but her control of the area is only temporary, and the Iron Guard Corps has begun to concentrate its efforts on trying to take control of key transportation facilities in Bucharest. The streets of Bucharest have been turned into a battlefield as some hastily armed government troops and elements of the Iron Guard in green uniforms have begun street battles, littered with barricades, bunkers and the sound of gunfire, while the residents of Bucharest have been plunged into a state of unspeakable fear."
 RomaniaCore.20.a: "The fate of the country is at stake here!"
 
 RomaniaCore.21.t: "Assassination of Codreanu"
 RomaniaCore.21.d: "The private spy organization "Moon Timer", which belongs to Remilia, has prepared an assassination attempt against the head of the Iron Guard, Codreanu himself. Although the assassination of Codreanu will not be enough to destroy the Iron Guard's offensive, the brief confusion it will bring will give the military forces loyal to Remilia a chance to react. Remilia herself, however, seems to have misgivings about the assassination, as Codreanu still seems to have the key information she needs. Therefore, there is a parallel mission to this assassination, which is the theft of confidential information from the Iron Guard Corps."
 RomaniaCore.21.a: "The assassination was successful!"
 RomaniaCore.21.b: "Codreanu dodged a bullet."
 
 RomaniaCore.22.t: "Coronation of Remilia"
 RomaniaCore.22.d: "The coronation of Remilia Scarlet will be held in place as soon as possible, many in the government believe that the coronation will be key to ensuring the loyalty of the military, but the executive branch of the government and most of the decision makers remain in the Bucharest Parliament and government agencies. In any case, ensuring Remilia's successful coronation will be the key to ensuring that the current government is not destroyed by the Iron Guard."
 RomaniaCore.22.a: "The coronation went well"
 RomaniaCore.22.b: "A bomb detonated at the ceremony!"
 
 RomaniaCore.23.t: "Storming of Bucharest Parliament"
 RomaniaCore.23.d: "As a final attempt to seize power, the Iron Guard has decided to launch a general attack on the Bucharest Parliament and the government section, where the armed forces of the Iron Guard will plan to seize the Bucharest Parliament building, the Bucharest City Hall, and the police station. The Iron Guard has committed all its fighting forces in the Bucharest area, and if this move does not succeed, then the Iron Guard's forces will quickly disintegrate."
 RomaniaCore.23.a: "The Iron Guard's gamble has succeeded"
 RomaniaCore.23.b: "The Iron Guard's onslaught has been thwarted"
 
 RomaniaCore.24.t: "Remilia's speech"
 RomaniaCore.24.d: "After her successful coronation as the new king of Romania, Remilia Scarlet has destroyed her greatest enemy, the Iron Guard, and eased the conflicts within the royal family and the government. In a radio address from Bucharest yesterday, Remilia, as the new king, announced that the political unrest in Romania is over, that the Iron Guard has been destroyed and that her government will not hesitate to punish any "saboteurs" who try to continue endangering public safety and to guarantee the safety and freedom of every Romanian citizen. freedom. Remilia promised that she would personally form a stronger and more robust government to promote national unity, avoid the encroachment and threat of "evil forces" like the Iron Guard, and continue the fight to defend Romania's sovereignty and territorial integrity."
 RomaniaCore.24.a: "Let's wait and see!"
 
 RomaniaCore.25.t: "Knowledge's remedy"
 RomaniaCore.25.d: "The death of King Vlad III has hit the country hard, and the heir, Remilia, has lost the ability to perform her duties and take control of the situation. In this situation, Remilia's chief of staff, Patchouli Knowledge, decided to step out from behind the scenes and maintain the situation. Under the protection of the Bucharest City Defense Force, Pachauri Noreiki made a speech at the Bucharest Parliament, asking all parties to hold their positions and maintain order. Although the normally unusually calm scholar suffered an emotional asthma attack during the speech, which was only relieved by inhaling hormone medication with the help of the crowd, she finished the speech successfully. She announced that she would proceed with the restoration of the Romanian parliament and the formation of an accountable government accountable to the parliament and the purging of the Iron Guard."
 RomaniaCore.25.a: "Can she heal the country's wounds?"
 
 RomaniaCore.26.t: "Reunion"
 RomaniaCore.26.d: "True to its mission, the Moon Timer has successfully captured a mysterious high-ranking member of the Iron Guard, Levatine, and brought him to the underground meeting room of Remilia's personal fortress, the Red Magic House. "The underground meeting room. Of course, Remilia knows who this "Levatine" really is, she is Remilia's sister Flandre Scarlet. When Remilia enters the parlor, wearing the white dress she always wears at home, and sees the girl in the green uniform, her eyes full of resentment, she realizes that she doesn't know her sister anymore."
 RomaniaCore.26.a: ""Flan, what the hell is wrong with you?""
 
 RomaniaCore.27.t: "Reunion"
 RomaniaCore.27.d: ""Are you surprised, sister? Are you angry that your sister has made her own choice? What were you doing, sister, while I was leading the regiment in Transylvania, born to fight for the future of this country?" Remilia froze for a moment and said calmly, "Flan, the Iron Guards have never really been loyal to this country. They have always conspired to destroy the order of this country. No matter what has happened before, there is no reason for you to go against this country." Flandre felt unusually angry and snarled, "This country? Who are you to say that? Do you want to talk about the country in the hands of you nobles and plutocrats? You continue to wantonly monopolize power, accumulate wealth, and then distribute that wealth to your foreign friends. Yes, you will only continue to shackle and abuse the people of this country, crushing their will with your dark rule, just as you keep me locked up in the basement day after day, ravaging my soul and keeping me in the company of darkness ......""
 RomaniaCore.27.a: ""Flan, you stop saying that!""
 RomaniaCore.27.b: ""Flan, I'm sorry...""
 
 RomaniaCore.28.t: "Boiling the beans and burn the beanstalks, the beans weep in the kettle"
 RomaniaCore.28.d: ""I digress! Remilia, your arrogance and greed have destroyed this country, how much more will you destroy me?! What more will you do to your own sister? Hang your sister, shoot her, or put her in the basement again, just like you did with those loyal Iron Guard members?" Frandolou seemed to have lost her mind and roared at Remilia. Terror and anger flooded Remilia's mind at the same time, and she roared back, "Flandorou, shut up! Do you know what I've done for this war these past few years? Do you know what I've done for you? If it weren't for me, you'd probably be in the execution chamber of Bucharest Prison by now!" \n\nFlandre got even angrier: "Do you still want to threaten me? As expected of my sister, that's all you've got. Ah, maybe I shouldn't call you sister at all, you traitor, bastard, traitor!" Saying that, Flandre put her hand into the pocket of her green uniform. At that moment, the sniper who was at a distance to protect Remilia's safety sensed the difference and immediately shot Flandre in the chest. When she fell down, a smile full of resentment was on the corner of her mouth, while Remilia didn't even have time to say "wait". \n\n Remilia went up to check, found her Flandre holding not weapons, but their former group photo - the original Flandre even in the Iron Guard also carry their photos with them. The guards who heard the gunshots and Patchouli Knowledge and others found Remilia, who had fainted, and Flandre, who had fallen in a pool of blood and had died. Since then, Remilia has been shut up and no longer receives anyone except Knowledge, nor does she attend any public events. Once again, there was a vacuum in the center of power in Bucharest."
 RomaniaCore.28.a: "A tragedy"
 
 RomaniaCore.29.t: "Reunion?"
 RomaniaCore.29.d: "Flandre was silent for a moment, and the two sat looking at each other, both with their heads down. Suddenly Flandre "Wahh" cried out, the original resentment and murderous aura on his face was swept away. Remilia suddenly felt that time had suddenly returned to the old days, the face full of childish sister seems to have returned. Flandre cried and shouted "Remilia, you bastard, you caused this, you have to pay for it! ......" Remilia gradually frowned, stood up, suddenly hugged Flandre, stroking the back of this familiar and strange sister. Flandorou's green uniform looked rather comical in comparison with Remilia's gown, but none of that mattered. Remilia whispered, "Flan ...... is sorry, it was all my fault, and I promise you that I will make it all up, heal these wounds with a strong, united new nation, and make up for everything I've done to you.""
 RomaniaCore.29.a: ""I will do it.""
 
 RomaniaCore.30.t: "Conflict intensifies"
 RomaniaCore.30.d: "The defeat in Carpathia intensified the conflict between Flanders III and the Iron Guard. Flanders III and his staff believed that the Iron Guard Corps had been hamstringing the government's actions and distracting it from its power. They also believed that the Iron Guard's paramilitary organization had diverted much of the manpower and material resources that could have been used for the regular army. On the Iron Guard side, Codreanu believes that it was the NRF government's corruption and incompetence, the greed of the monopolistic oligarchy and the laziness and selfishness of the landowning groups that caused the war to fail. Mistrust and tensions are spreading throughout the country, and there are fears that the conflict between the Iron Guard and the government will soon erupt."
 RomaniaCore.30.a: "All it takes is a little spark"
 
 RomaniaCore.31.t: "Rumors"
 RomaniaCore.31.d: "Just when the situation was at its most tense, rumors began to appear on the streets of Bucharest that Vlad III was about to take steps to purge the Iron Guard. There seemed to be some perverse military movements around the capital, and the number of police officers in a part of the city became larger. Codrianu called an emergency meeting and asked the Iron Guard members to change the location of their lair. Now Bucharest is full of people, some stores have even chosen to shut down to avoid the impending storm, pedestrians on the streets have become scarce, and the tension seems to have reached its peak."
 RomaniaCore.31.a: "A storm is coming?"
 
 RomaniaCore.32.t: "Assassination of Codreanu"
 RomaniaCore.32.d: "Despite the fact that Codrianu changed his course of action and urgently changed the location of a part of his lair, the assassins came to the door. The members of the Iron Guard regiment engaged in a fierce gun battle with the assassins in an Orthodox church to protect their leader, and due to the small scale of the event, Codrianu did not have many members of the regiment with him, so perhaps only Archangel Michael could protect him from this."
 RomaniaCore.32.a: "But the archangel did not dwell on him"
 RomaniaCore.32.b: "Codrianus dodged a bullet"
 
 RomaniaCore.33.t: "Retaliatory assassination against Vlad III"
 RomaniaCore.33.d: "Archangel Michael failed to protect Codrianu, and the regiment's respected leader was shot several times in the chest and killed instantly. The members of the Iron Guard were extremely angry, and apparently, this was an order from Vlad III. After taking over the situation, Cantacuzino immediately ordered a revenge assassination against Vlad III. However, the palace was as unaware of this series of events and the defense force was not increased at all. A member of the death squad used a pistol to fire three shots while Vlad III was tasting wine, killing him immediately. The assassination was a complete success, although the team member was subsequently shot by the guards indiscriminately."
 RomaniaCore.33.a: "The Downfall of a Tyrant"
 
 RomaniaCore.34.t: "Darnic's second coup?"
 RomaniaCore.34.d: "With the death of Vlad III and Remilia's final victory in the fight against the Iron Guard, Darnic Preston achieved his secret purpose: to use Remilia to destroy his opposition. Yes, it was he who created the tension in Bucharest, fabricated the rumor that Vlad III would purge the Iron Guard, and even arranged the assassination against Codrianu himself. Now that the situation is developing in the direction Darnic expects, it's time for him to step in personally. Of course he can also be content to hunker down with Remilia, after all, most of his goals have been accomplished."
 RomaniaCore.34.a: "There is no need to act anymore"
 RomaniaCore.34.b: "The second coup was successful"
 RomaniaCore.34.c: "Patchouli Knowledge thwarted the coup"
 
 RomaniaCore.35.t: "Darnic's conspiracy was uncovered"
 RomaniaCore.35.d: "Archangel Michael protects Codrianu! Not only that, but the Iron Guard captured the assassin and extracted a confession. It turns out that from the previous rumors of purges to this assassination, it was all planned by Darnic Preston. Obviously, he was hoping that the Iron Guard and the king would fight over the snipe and he would reap the benefits. Now it's time to make his plot public. The relationship between the Iron Guard and the king may be eased, so we can unite again against the Mazars."
 RomaniaCore.35.a: "This is good"
 
 RomaniaCore.36.t: "Darnic seeks to suspend the council"
 RomaniaCore.36.d: "Since the Iron Guard's onslaught against the Bucharest council has failed, Darnic Preston wants the army to suspend the council to purge the remnants of the Iron Guard, but a portion of the Thousand Boundary Tree members, led by Fiore Fulvij, are strongly opposed, believing that Darnic is trying to use the opportunity to seize power."
 RomaniaCore.36.a: "Darnic has successfully exploited everyone's panic"
 RomaniaCore.36.b: "Yet the army chose to trust Forvedge"

 RomaniaCore.37.t: "[ROM.GetName]'s Common Defense Agreement"
 RomaniaCore.37.d: "Having regained lost ground together, [ROM.GetName] is having the intention of constructing a regional defense alliance, and of course the first target of the alliance is us. \n\nA strong Balkan bloc should be able to defend itself against the threat of the members of the old alliance, and as a small, but sophisticated industrial country, [CZE.GetName] should contribute to this."
 RomaniaCore.37.a: "We are willing to join!" 
 RomaniaCore.37.b: "However, this is not proper" 

 RomaniaCore.38.t: "[CZE.GetName] Join the faction"
 RomaniaCore.38.d: ""
 RomaniaCore.38.a: "This is good!"  
 
 RomaniaCore.39.t: "[CZE.GetName] guarantee our independence"
 RomaniaCore.39.d: ""
 RomaniaCore.39.a: "Fine."  
 
 RomaniaCore.40.t: "[CZE.GetName] refused"
 RomaniaCore.40.d: ""
 RomaniaCore.40.a: "Huh?!"

 RomaniaCore.41.t: "Chetnik exile"
 RomaniaCore.41.d: "Since the failure of the Little Entente to intervene in Hungary in 1919, Yugoslavia has been politically unstable eventually resulting in a bloody civil war between the King's Party and the Communists, with the two sides tearing apart for nearly a decade in the mountains of Bosnia or in the forests of Serbia. \The Communist Party, now under the leadership of Marshal Tito, has taken complete control of Yugoslavia, and only a remnant of the Chetniks, led by their leader Dracha, has sought refuge in our country."
 RomaniaCore.41.a: "All right! Entry granted."
 
 RomaniaEvent.1.t: "Romania offers to buy weapons"
 RomaniaEvent.1.d: "Romania has offered to buy weapons from our country for their war with Hungary. Their representatives hinted that the Hungarian side has German support and that a Romanian victory would help to suppress German influence in Eastern Europe. The price they offered would have been unacceptable to us in normal times. But right now our country is in a deep economic crisis, and a batch of arms orders would be just the thing to relieve some of the urgent needs ......"
 RomaniaEvent.1.a: "Sell it to them"
 RomaniaEvent.1.b: "No!"
 
 RomaniaEvent.2.t: "France agrees to sell weapons"
 RomaniaEvent.2.d: "The negotiators on the French side accepted our arms order with a slight hesitation, a great diplomatic victory."
 RomaniaEvent.2.a: "Earned it!"
 
 RomaniaEvent.3.t: "France refuses to sell weapons"
 RomaniaEvent.3.d: "Despite the deep economic crisis, France refuses to sell weapons."
 RomaniaEvent.3.a: "Assholes!"
 
 RomaniaEvent.4.t: "Romania offers secret deal"
 RomaniaEvent.4.d: "Moscow, for its part, has been ignoring the needs of the Ukrainian region by constantly taking food from Ukrainian collective farms, even though Ukraine is already deep in famine. Now the bourgeois government of [ROM.GetNameDef] is ready to make a not so honorable deal with us. They want to secretly sell grain to Ukraine by means of border trade, and as far as we know, some of this grain is bought from Moscow at low prices. These bastards have evil intentions, but the people are starving. What should we do?"
 RomaniaEvent.4.a: "We have no choice."
 RomaniaEvent.4.b: "Do not give in to them!"
 
 RomaniaEvent.5.t: "[UKR.GetName] agreed to the deal"
 RomaniaEvent.5.d: "Despite being very angry, [UKR.GetName]'s leader [UKR.GetLeader] agreed to the border trade offer we made. They are now dumbfounded, unable to say anything, and can only watch as grain is taken away from Moscow and sold at low prices and sold to them at high prices by us."
 RomaniaEvent.5.a: "Blame Moscow!"
 
 RomaniaEvent.6.t: "[UKR.GetName] refused the deal"
 RomaniaEvent.6.d: "[UKR.GetName]'s leader [UKR.GetLeader] rhetorically rejected our demands, claiming that our plot to divide the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in this way was bound not to succeed."
 RomaniaEvent.6.a: "Forget it, then."
 
 RomaniaEvent.7.t: "Romania offers to sell weapons"
 RomaniaEvent.7.d: "The issue of weapons has been a problem for us since we rose up. Romania has offered a deal to send us a shipment of weapons by way of border trade. There are some weapons that are quite old, but we don't seem to have a choice."
 RomaniaEvent.7.a: "Buy it."
 RomaniaEvent.7.b: "Treacherous businessman, don't buy."
 
 RomaniaEvent.8.t: "[UKR.GetName] agreed to the deal"
 RomaniaEvent.8.d: "Despite the fact that we offered a higher price than on the international market, the Ukrainians, who were desperate for weapons, chose to buy them. We made another profit."
 RomaniaEvent.8.a: "Another win!"
 
 RomaniaEvent.9.t: "[UKR.GetName] rejected the deal"
 RomaniaEvent.9.d: "[UKR.GetName]'s rejected our deal. Then let them fight the Russians empty-handed."

 ##Alice
 alice_event.1.t: "The suburbs of Bucharest"
 alice_event.1.d: "Alice Margatroid，A young girl who lives alone on the outskirts of Bucharest is just a technician who runs a shop that repairs furniture and cars. Sometimes she also works as a tailor and performs puppet shows for children in community theatres. She always wears blue, white and red clothes and long skirts, very simple but always spotless. Although there are rumors that she was involved in the rebellion of the Sangvis of Ukraine in 1922, and that she once repaired cars for the Communists and made green uniforms for the Iron Guards, the rumors are rumors. Alice's quiet life may go on until Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia, a hot big shot in Romania personally knocks on the door of her house."
 alice_event.1.a: ""Come in, please""
 
 alice_event.2.t: "Margatroid's house"
 alice_event.2.d: ""Even if Vlad comes in person, the treatment is the same."Said Alice. Darnic was a little surprised by Alice's indifference, but he calmed down and got to the point as soon as possible: "Miss Alice Margatroid, I'm sure you know that the Yggdmillennia family is not interested in an ordinary tinker." Darnic scanned the various sizes and shapes of dolls in the house. "Yggdmillennia needs these dolls, or, more accurately, to manipulate the rope of these dolls." It's not easy to give full play to your talents all the time in such a small workshop. " Alice just took a sip of black tea. "I don't understand what you're saying, Mr. Darnic.". "Miss Margatroid, you need to know where you are.""
 alice_event.2.a: ""You have heard of the Death of the Upright, haven't you?""
 
 alice_event.3.t: "Alice Margatroid joint Yggdmillennia"
 alice_event.3.d: "Darnic, the patriarch of the Yggdmillennia family, recently invited a young girl whose clothes and living habits are out of tune with the people around her, a person known as the "puppeteer", Alice Margatroid. Ah, maybe it's because Darnic was humiliated by Aozaki Touko in the Clock Tower. It is difficult to say that he is looking for an opponent for Touko? But these are all rumors within Yggdmillennia. Although not trusted by other family members represented by Forvedge, Miss Margatroid began to work."
 alice_event.3.a: "This is a good thing."
 
 alice_event.4.t: "A cafe in Bucharest"
 alice_event.4.d: "Patchouli："Unexpectedly, Alice, who once refused to step out of town, moved to the city."\nAlice："Patchouli, the girl who didn't even want to go to the bathroom to leave the cellar, went to the street."\nPatchouli："Alice，I hope you understand what you're doing. Darnic is the same as Codreanu, and even the clock tower is not willing to accept him. In terms of honesty, Codreanu is even much better than him."\nAlice："It seems that Miss Remilia is not enough for you to worry about. I advise you to be careful not to be slaughtered by Vlad's fury one day."\nPatchouli："It's as difficult as ever to reason with you. I just want to remind you:""
 alice_event.4.a: ""Don't forget our agreement.""
 
 alice_event.5.t: "Formation of the engineering station"
 alice_event.5.d: "Since Darnic expanded the influence of the Yggdmillennia family in Romania and took over the production and construction of Bioroids as he wished, he tried to extend his hand even further. Since the "invitation" of Margatroid to the Yggdmillennia group, the family began to have the strength to compete with the pro-King's consortium in the industrial field. Now Darnic has a plan to set up an engineering station controlled by the Yggdmillennia Group to provide engineering support for the Romanian war machine, and Margatroid has agreed to participate in this plan."
 alice_event.5.a: "This is good"
 alice_event.5.b: "Not necessary"
 
 alice_event.6.t: "Integrate the arsenal"
 alice_event.6.d: "Darnic, in the process of expanding the Thousand Boundary Tree Group into the engineering industry, realized that he could apply to Vlad III for a "charter" on the grounds of the special needs of the Transylvanian War, so that his engineering station could be authorized to produce some weapons, which would facilitate Darnic's further plans. This would facilitate Darnic's further plans. So, what was Darnic's decision?"
 alice_event.6.a: "We must expand our influence"
 alice_event.6.b: "This will leave consequences"
 
 alice_event.7.t: "Integrate logistical systems"
 alice_event.7.d: "Due to the modest success of Darnic's engineering station, the small experimental municipality established on the outskirts of Bucharest has taken shape. The Thousand Realms Tree group now has the ability to continue developing the engineering station, allowing it to take over important logistical systems in the military. This is certainly beneficial for increasing the influence of the Thousand Boundary Tree, but there is no doubt that it will also touch the interests of some in the military."
 alice_event.7.a: "It is necessary to do so."
 alice_event.7.b: "Forget about it."

 alice_event.8.t: "Integrate Bucharest Power"
 alice_event.8.d: "Miss Margatroid, who seems to be quite knowledgeable about electromechanical control, believes that integrating the electrical systems of Bucharest and the surrounding area into the Thousand Boundary Tree Engineering Station will improve the efficiency of both the bionic technology equipment and the electrical system itself. This is still the first plan initiated by this engineer of few words, but accepting her proposal would mean more costly investment and might trigger discontent on the part of the palace."
 alice_event.8.a: "But it's worth it."
 alice_event.8.b: "What does she know about electrical systems?"

 alice_event.9.t: "Building an armor research center"
 alice_event.9.d: "The Goliath remote-controlled tank designed by Alice Margatroid seems to have been a great success, and although it still requires a long wire to control, the remote-controlled tank has been able to successfully perform some difficult demolition tasks. Now the Vrvej siblings are proposing to expand our reach by establishing an armored research institute at the Thousand Boundary Tree engineering station, and this will also have a positive impact on our war with Hungary."
 alice_event.9.a: "Haha, good."
 alice_event.9.b: "Don't burden yourself"
 
 alice_event.10.t: "Reincarnation"
 alice_event.10.d: "Alice Margatroid seems to be nothing more than an elegantly subdued but somewhat eccentric engineer since she's been in residence. She always seemed to have a disdain for Darnic Preston, but also reliably single-handedly built a series of advanced engineering platforms for the Thousand Boundary Tree Group. But that's where Darnic Preston miscalculated. While he was obsessed with his total victory over Flanders III and the Iron Guard elements, this "engineer" stabbed him in the back. In fact, Alice Margatroyd had gained good relations with the military hierarchy when she provided the munitions design, and had planted some people in the electrical system and municipal authorities in Bucharest, in addition to Pachauri Norecki in the palace, who was also her mole. So, with the help of all the forces, Miss Margatroid successfully launched a coup d'état, occupied the experimental city of the Thousand Boundary Tree Group and commanded the garrison of Bucharest to declare martial law. Darnic was so clever that he lost control of Romania, which he had worked so hard for."
 alice_event.10.a: "How is it her!?"

 alice_event.11.t: "The Bucharest Trial"
 alice_event.11.d: "As key figures in the Yddgmellia group declared their allegiance to Alice Margatroid, senior government officials and some high ranking members of the military also came out in support of Margatroid to "purge subversive elements and German spies". After careful consideration, Miss Margotroyd decided that in order to ensure the legitimacy of the new regime, she should not disregard the law and use widespread political violence. So she decided to use the resources at her disposal to file a lawsuit in the Bucharest court against what she declared to be a series of "traitors" and to have the entire trial broadcast nationwide by the broadcast media. \Naturally, there was no doubt about the outcome of the trial, as Darnikc Prestone was convicted in absentia on multiple counts of abuse of power, collaboration with the enemy, and embezzlement. In fact, in order to protect himself, Darnic's confidant Forvedge brother and sister testified and provided a lot of internal information of the Yddgmellia Group to confirm that Darnic had "close unofficial contacts" with Germany before the Carpathian War. Subsequently, the Iron Guard capitanul Codreanu was also tried in absentia and convicted of unlawful subversion, murder, and unlawful incitement, and some core members of the death squad were sentenced to death in court and then taken to the execution chamber. \n Also tried was General Ion Antonescu. The secret telegram exchange between Antonescu and Codreanu was presented to the judge by the prosecutor, and after the judge read out the contents of the telegram, the senior officers who came down to the courtroom to observe the trial began to whisper and discuss -- obviously, they were shocked by the incident. Subsequently, Antonescu was sentenced to life imprisonment and stripped of all military rank and honors. \n Alice Margatroid, known to the public with some fear as "the Puppeteer of Bucharest," sat in a seat at the bottom of the court and listened quietly to the trial, occasionally asking a few questions indifferently. Only those in the know knew that she had manipulated the trial."
 alice_event.11.a: "There is a surprising silence in Bucharest tonight."
 
 alice_event.13.t: "Alice Margatroid excaped"
 alice_event.13.d: "The power of [From.GetRulingPartyLong] has brought a major turning point in the political situation in Romania. On any harbinger night, Alice Margatroid detonated the Yggdmillennia laboratory she managed and fled the control area. Although the guard soldiers tried to intercept, Alice's pre-set remote control weapon successfully hindered the hunt. One day later, she jumped on the last ship that left Romania and fled the country."
 alice_event.13.a: "All in vain?"

Named after Captain Marin Orita (a captain in the Military Technical Corps), the weapon features an impressive rate of fire of 400-600 rounds per minute and fed through detachable 25/30 round magazines."
