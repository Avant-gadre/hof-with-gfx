To date, Plerati is still in the city of Fiume, who was renamed Rijeka. She recently claimed that what American novelist Lovecraft has said "all are true", and at the end wrote, "We should return to that great era through all means such as war, plague and hunger, and let the original glory shine on the earth again.""
