 intro.0.desc:0 "Credit: Part of Germany design, setting, flags, and some of icons are from famous Fuhrerreich Mod and TNO(the new order) Mod. Please check it on the steam workshop if you like it. \n This mod is a TypeMoon-themed and Anime-themed mod, try to blend the WWII world, or the historical world, with characters from TypeMoon ACG series, especially Fate Series, made by a small group lead by Entarogan. This mod does not adopt the original type-moon universe and keep the realistic WWII universe instead. Concepts like servant, Grail War and Root, do not make sense here. Grail, Alaya, Magic, etc. should be interpreted as religious and political symbols. \n All ideologies, religious,racial,national ideas are simulations of those real exsits in history or TM original works and are not any real ideas held by any one of authors. The authors are opposite to all kinds of racism,fascism,nazism,terrorism and respect every nation and religion beliefs.\n Forgive me for my Chinglish please."

 POLITICS_NERO_CLAUDIUS_DESC:0 "For thousands of years, Nero has been the subject of historians and Christians, but the historical records of her own experiences are mostly indirect and suspicious. The Senate after the reconstruction of Rome is still in a tense relationship with Nero. Compared to the nobility, Nero Claudius prefers the average citizen. However, her populist political concept, her passionate personality, and her contempt for traditional ideas have brought her closer to the National Fascist Party."

 POLITICS_ARTURIA_PENDRAGON_DESC:0 "In Britain, which has a deep monarchy tradition, King Arthur’s status in the country is unparalleled. Although the main ethnic group in Britain today is the Anglo-Saxon who King Arthur fought in the past, King Arthur will still guard her new people. For her, it is the responsibility of the monarch to guard the daily life of the British people compared to the artificially constructed concept of nationality and ethnicity. This Britain, of course, also includes the colonies of the British Empire in the world."
 
 POLITICS_ANIMUSPHERE_DESC:0 "The Animusphere family occupies one of the twelve monarchs of the Clock Tower, and Olga Marie, who inherited the inheritance of the father, became one of the most influential politicians of the clock tower, and at the same time, the celestial body of Clock Tower, In fact, the plan for an artificial celestial body has been placed on her desk.

 POLITICS_HARVEY_DESC:0 "As a new generation of heirs to the Western European consortium, Leo Harvey was trained as an ideal and innocent leader.

If the development of extremism will eventually threaten the survival of the consortium, Harvey may take action."
 
 POLITICS_MARIE_ANTOINETTE_DESC:0 "Marie Antoinette, who had once lost her country, knows how to learn from history. In France, with its traditional aristocratic spirit and revolutionary enthusiasm, Mary undoubtedly has to face an unprecedented complexity. The family identity of the Habsburg dynasty is a double-edged sword. In France, where nationalism prevails, it may bring disaster to Marie, but perhaps it can also become a tool for France to extend its influence in Austria and Hungary; It even offers possibilities for a larger France, although this possibility is undoubtedly dangerous."
 
 POLITICS_JEANNE_DARC_DESC:0 "Jeanne d'Arc, a French national hero and a Catholic saint, has an irreplaceable position in the hearts of the French. She can bring the strongest spiritual inspiration to the people on both nationalism and religion. Jeanne d'Arc is undoubtedly the iconic figure of France against England, but the international situation of the twentieth century, especially the rise of Germany and Italy, makes Jeanne d'Arc need to rethink the position of France: in addition to the contradiction of nationalism, the conflicts of political idea also play an increasingly important role in the modern world."
 
 POLITICS_NOBUNAGA_DESC:0 "Oda Nobunaga, an ambitious daimyō, finally grasped the Japanese rule in chaos. In order to expand her military dictatorship and promote western-styled militarism ideas, Oda has been planning to weaken the influence of the national Shinto and the traditional Buddhist power in Japan. At the same time, people in Japan who are dissatisfied with and plan to overthrow her are everywhere. There are rumors that Oda Nobunaga has discussed with the staff the plan to conquer China in the midst of China's weakness, but this plan has never been confirmed by any official."
 
 POLITICS_SHIKI_DESC:0 "Ryougi Shiki used to be a mysterious Japanese urban legend, but there is no doubt that she is a real person. Her whereabouts and secrets, she ruled her Yakuza and business empire in the shadow of the city, and grasped the information of affairs in Japan through her husband's intelligence network. Although Ryougi Shiki is weird in character and has no interest in politics on the table, she does not rule out the possibility of cooperation with Japanese liberals and other Zaibatsus."
 
 POLITICS_RYOMA_DESC:0 "The Liberal Party is a loose alliance formed by the Japanese liberals to fight the shogunate and other right-wing forces. It consists of some chaebols and a group of ambitious reformers, as well as Japanese in Britain and the United States. Sakamoto Ryoma is one of these reformers. A group of people led by Sakamoto believed that the Meiji Restoration of Japan was an incomplete nationalist change and did not really touch the essence of the Western world. Some of them even believed that the Meiji Restoration was the origin of a series of political retrogressions after Japan, and sought a true revolution."
 
 eng_gray_desc:0 "Gray is a student of El Melloi II, a member of the Clock Tower, but more importantly, she is a distant relative of King Arthur.

As the representative of the king is in the clock tower, Gray can successfully coordinate the size conflict between Round Table and Clock Tower. At the same time, Gray is the organizer of a secret research project named “Rhongomyniad” and is directly responsible to King Arthur himself."
 
 POLITICS_OKITA_ALTER_DESC:0 "The Alaya Party is a Japanese far-right party that combines religion, mysticism, nationalism and pan-Asianism and has its own paramilitary organization. Okita Souji(Alter), is not so much a spiritual leader as a symbol. The members of the Alaya Party believe that liberalism and communism are just different paths of conspiracy through which Europeans will conquer the world, and thus adhere to the anti-communist and anti-capitalism claims. It is worth noting that its members believe that members can reach a collective unconscious called “Alaya” in Buddhism through hard religious practice, and members can become the agent of “Alaya” to resist invaders from the West."
 
 okita_souji_desc:0 "Okita Souji, who has been trained as a hangman, has become one of the best fighters in Japan and has strong maneuverability. The creed of the Okita Souji as a warrior is to obey her master forever, instead of asking the so-called right and wrong. In the twentieth century, when various ideologies developed rapidly and extremism flooded, this became almost a virtue. In any case, Miss Okita's loyalty to the shogunate will not change under any circumstances."
 
 POLITICS_AGRAVAIN_DESC:0 "King Arthur’s right arm, Agravain, is the key figure for the stable existence of the Knights of the Round Table. With the strategy and the iron fist to maintain the stability of the country's internal affairs and diplomacy, Agravain is the person who is willing to do dirty work. However, although he is full of suspicions about other Knights, his loyalty to King Arthur is undeniable."
