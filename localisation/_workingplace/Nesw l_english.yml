The Germans supported the "Black Virgin" to subvert the kingdom, so it is not surprising that this result is now present.

She monopolized the interpretation power of the idea after the accidental death of Marinetti, the founder of "Futurism", and gradually moved to a...staggering point. In the words of the former partner Gabriele d'Annunzio, "I didn't know that this guy wanted to drag the whole world into the abyss." To date, Plerati is still in the city of Fiume, who was renamed Rijeka. She recently claimed that what American novelist Lovecraft has said "all are true", and at the end wrote, "We should return to that great era through all means such as war, plague and hunger, and let the original glory shine on the earth again.""
