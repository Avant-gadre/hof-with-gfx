 SPC_reprofessionalize_the_military_desc: "By necessity our army has been rebuilt from those who were not educated in the strict discipline of military life.

 SPC_hinder_nkvd_interference_desc: "The Soviet NKVD has been interfering in internal Spanish affairs for too long.

 SPC_seize_the_gold_reserves: "Seize the Gold Reserves"
 SPC_seize_the_gold_reserves_desc: "The Republic's gold reserves are at risk of falling into Fascist, or possibly even worse, Stalinist hands.

 SPC_foreign_arms_purchases: "Foreign Arms Purchases"
 SPC_foreign_arms_purchases_desc: "The gold reserves we 'liberated' could be used to obtain foreign arms, which we are in desperate need of. International opinion is not necessarily supportive of us, so we will likely have to go through unorthodox channels to receive these, however..."

 SPC_class_war: "Class War"
 SPC_class_war_desc: "The concept of the Popular Front is flawed; the worker can never truly be free as long as they are forced to work together with the bourgeoisie. Only all-out uncompromising class war can bring us the freedom we desire, even if this means fighting the capitalists and the fascists at the same time."
 SPC_all_must_bear_the_torch: "All Must Bear the Torch"
 SPC_all_must_bear_the_torch_desc: "Every person is a revolution unto itself; if not for the bravery and ferocity of the individual the collective would fall in the face of its enemies.

 SPC_fortify_la_linea_de_la_concepcion_desc: "La Línea de la Concepción is the first bastion against the enemy that lies beyond. With adequate defenses we should be able to meet any attack that comes from Gibraltar head-on."
 SPC_communal_military_strategies: "Communal Military Strategies"
 SPC_communal_military_strategies_desc: "Organizing large-scale warfare while remaining true to the tenets of anarchism is a great challenge. It is also one that we must rise to meet, as without it all that we fight for is lost."

 SPC_appeal_for_increased_autonomy: "Appeal for Increased Autonomy"
 SPC_appeal_for_increased_autonomy_desc: "The price of the [SOV.GetAdjective] aid that made our victory possible has been subservience. We have shown to be loyal and capable defenders of socialism, and certainly this is recognized in Moscow. Perhaps we can convince them to relax the reins."
