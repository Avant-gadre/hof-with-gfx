As the Left beleaguers our Christian civilization, the Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas will stand in its defense and give Spain true unity and a new spirit. Parliament will submit to the will of the people, or we will eliminate it."
 SPF_unify_the_nationalist_front: "Unify the Nationalist Front"
 SPF_unify_the_nationalist_front_desc: "The rebellion, or \"Nationalists\" as they have begun to call themselves, are a loose assortment of groups united only in their desire to overthrow the Republic.

 SPF_portuguese_aid: "Portuguese Aid"
 SPF_portuguese_aid_desc: "We must accept aid from wherever it may come.

 SPF_save_the_alcazar: "Save the Alcázar!"
 SPF_save_the_alcazar_desc: "The Alcázar in Toledo is still held by forces loyal to our cause, but they are under siege! Liberating them, though not strategically important, would be a major propaganda victory, and cement Francisco Franco's position as de facto leader of the military junta."

 SPF_adopt_the_26_points: "Adopt the 26 Points"
 SPF_adopt_the_26_points_desc: "Having conveniently removed the stipulation against the merger of political parties from the Falange's \"27 Points\", the resulting \"26 Points\" makes for a good party manifesto that we can borrow from for inspiration on government policies."

 SPF_the_tangiers_enclave_desc: "The city of Tangiers was made into an international zone in 1923, under the joint administration of France, Spain, and Britain.

 SPF_secure_the_national_defense_council_desc: "Leaderless, our cause is headed by a Junta of military and civilian leaders with loosely-aligned goals.

 SPF_primo_de_rivera_prisoner_exchange_desc: "The founder of the Falange, José Antonio Primo de Rivera, son of the old dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, was imprisoned even before the start of the civil war.

 SPF_suspend_the_constitution: "Suspend the Constitution"
 SPF_suspend_the_constitution_desc: "We will make no progress as long as we adhere to a constitution that has repeatedly proven its fallibility and weakness.

 SPF_sin_paquito_desc: "The government, fearing his potential disloyalty, has sent Francisco Franco to command the forces in the Canarias.
