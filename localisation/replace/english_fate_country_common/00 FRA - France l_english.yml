 lr_france.18.a: "We should not confront France now."
 lr_france.18.b: "France does not keep her promise, and so won't we."

 lr_france.20.t: "A possibility of Mediterranean Alliance"
 lr_france.20.d: "It was the military conquest of our great emperor Napoleon I that brought the awakening of national consciousness to the Apennine Peninsula, so they should have allied with us... Well, naturally it's not that simple, and after a lot of things happen our relationship doesn't get so good. But one thing is certain, they proclaim Rome is just for seizing territory, and we could separate some meaningless colonies in this regard, and it would be good for both of us if it could form a military alliance."
 lr_france.20.a: "We can give them parts of West Africa and Somaliland."
 lr_france.20.b: "France is indivisible!"
 
 lr_france.21.t: "France hopes to offer thier colonies for an alliance"
 lr_france.21.d: "No matter how the British and French advertise themselves, they will firmly divide the positive African continent into two large pieces and hold it in their hands. Naturally our new empire must have a duel with them, but in terms of our strength, it is very troublesome to deal with a family. of. So the French emperor Napoleon I proposed that the eastern part of French West Africa and Somaliland be exchanged for our alliance with him, and at the same time he hinted that we would use this land to attack the Republic of Congo, which was independent from Belgium in recent years. This is not only a good opportunity to expand the colony, but also gives us military backing."
 lr_france.21.a: "A nice proposal."
 lr_france.21.b: "Then give us Savoy and Corsica too!" 
 
 lr_france.22.t: "They also want Savoy and Corsica..."
 lr_france.22.d: "It must be said that the wings of this group of Lombard barbarians have grown longer and more arrogant. Our friendly alliance proposal has turned into their opportunity to claim territory. Savoy and Corsica? ! What a joke? ! If it is necessary to say that there are indeed many Italians in these two areas, and it is indeed the Apennine land that was once merged into France, then ..."
 lr_france.22.a: "No way!"

 lr_france.25.t: "France returned Corsica"
 lr_france.25.d: "The French agreed to partly add Corsica on the basis of the original agreement, so that Corsica, which once belonged to Genoa, and many compatriots will return together! After all, this is the hoemtown of the French Emperor, and it is still quite sincere to give it away."

 lr_france.25.b: "And what about Savoy?"   
 
 lr_france.26.t: "France has met our demands"

 lr_france.27.d: "After our unprecedented concession, the arrogant "Roman" refused. It seems that it was a mistake from the beginning."
 lr_france.27.a: "We will parade at Rome."

 lr_france.28.t: "Unexpected Result"
 lr_france.28.d: "The meeting between Queen Marie and Jeanne drew a disaster! The famous murderer and arsonist "Black Virgin" arrived first and almost caused the Queen to be unpredictable, while Kingdom General Gille de Raiss seemed to be "another Joan of Arc" in the court, after the Black Saint's terrorist attack on the Palace of Versailles failed. He declared, "Let us raise the banner of salvation again under the guidance of the Black Virgin!" He led his department to openly rebel in Orleans, and a large number of soldiers who were extremely dissatisfied with the restoration of the Kingdom have already invested this rebel and his black Virgin. . However, from the past words and deeds of the "Black Virgin", she was just a demented lunatic who wanted to "burn France". The brutal collective execution and scorched earth policy in the rebellious area quickly woke up the blindly followed soldiers, and the Kingdom's military has After the assembly is complete and declare war on the rebels, how far can she and the mad marshal's path of destruction go?"
 lr_france.28.a: "Ma colère ne finit jamais!"
 lr_france.29.t: "Seek Support?"
 lr_france.29.d: "On this issue, the Black Virgin and Gille de Raiss rarely had a disagreement. She bluntly said that she did not like Gille de Raiss's friend, and also the Italian artist Francesca Prelati who has been secretly funding terrorist activities. "Gille! The Germans have tanks! Do you know ?! This is not the time when you killed a few children in the castle to summon demons!" And Gille de Raiss, known for his tyranny, treated her With rare patience, "I understand, but the virgin, no matter how the times change, the devil is still in everyone's heart, and the thing we have to do is to awaken the devil in people's hearts instead of simple killing.""
 lr_france.29.a: ""That's you, I just want to fight the Hundred Years' War, that's all."" 
 lr_france.29.b: ""Maybe the hundred years of war are over ...""
 lr_france.30.t: "The French insurgents sought support from us?!"
 lr_france.30.d: "It is very strange that the Black Virgin, who has recently caused a chaos in France, even asked us for reinforcements. According to her request, we should send "large size" troops to wear French uniforms and go directly to the French territory to fight, and the reward she promised is to join our camp after winning, then ..."
 lr_france.30.a: "We will send out "volunteers""
 lr_france.30.b: "Where did this psychopath come from?"
 lr_france.31.t: "German volunteers comes!"
 lr_france.31.d: "They agreed! The German army has disguised itself across the border to accept our command!"
 lr_france.31.a: "Let's revenge together!"
 lr_france.32.t: "Germany refused"
 lr_france.32.d: ""Uh, Jeanne, I really didn't lie to you, it's not that we have friends who share a common enemy.""
 lr_france.32.a: ""OK, what about your old friend then?""
 lr_france.33.t: ""Oh, isn't this Gille and the Virgin?""
 lr_france.33.d: ""Uh, Plerati, my friend! You really are ready," "Ah? After all, it seems that the Vrigin doesn't like me very much, so I'll wait for you to make a statement before showing up. So This is the gift I gave you, but I sold my all belongings for these arms. ""
 lr_france.33.a: ""Why didn't you sell yourself?""
 lr_france.34.t: "Black Virgin seeks help from us"
 lr_france.34.d: "The current French regime does implement their unique reverse nationalist theory, and naturally the legitimacy of their regime tends to zero indefinitely. And the police force we sent in the past was simply not enough. The large number of guerrilla warfare in the countryside even caused many police officers used to law enforcement in Germany to suffer "heavy casualties". For this reason, the Black Virgin proposed that we send a real big figure, so who should be sent? It seems that she appreciates the imperial security bureau chief's methods."
 lr_france.34.a: "Then send Heydrich." 
 lr_france.34.b: "Send his assistant"
 lr_france.35.t: "Here comes Heydrich"
 lr_france.35.d: "Reinhard Heidrich saw a ruin and a woman in black when she got off the plane. There is no doubt that it was the Black Virgin who came in to become a topic in the political circle of Berlin. In fact, it is still the ruins of the former Champs Elysées. It seems that she is playing a real game."
 lr_france.35.a: "The two shook hands enthusiastically." 
 lr_france.36.t: "Here comes Heydrich.....'s assistant"
 lr_france.36.d: "When Ernst Kaltenbrunner got off the plane, he saw a ruin and a woman in black. There is no doubt that it was the Black Virgin who was repeatedly mentioned by Mr. Heidrich recently, and this "airport "It's actually the ruins of the former Champs Elysées, which is really a bit confusing."
 lr_france.36.a: "The two shook hands." 

 lr_france.37.t: "Consolidate Domination"
 lr_france.37.d: "In fact, our rule is limited to the area around Orleans. Almost every "French" is resisting our "daily behavior." Naturally, this is not surprising. After all, we are here to destroy them. However, there is no resistance in the castle of Tiffauges. After the renovation, the castle has been used as the headquarters of the National Secret Police. According to legend, Gilles de Rais has always used this as a base to carry out torture of children... Naturally, there will be no such "fun" and meaningless things now, but no matter whether they are opponents or potential opponents, they will step into the castle one by one. Gilderas seems to have invested greater enthusiasm than the military command in this regard."
 lr_france.37.a: "Every castle will have this feature." 
 lr_france.38.t: "New Culture Movement"
 lr_france.38.d: "It's time to destroy consumer culture! It should be back to the time of the damn Valois dynasty when everyone is favor of fighting! Of course, we have no reason to drive the "French" to fight for us, but what about that? It 's time to prepare for the premiere of Joan of Arc, directed by Antonin Artaud and Francisca Plerati, we will use a gun or a burning flask to keep everything in the house The poor worms in the movie get out and watch the movie! Maybe this will subvert their worldview ... All we demand is this effect!"
 lr_france.38.a: ""Prepare that, Gilles""  
 lr_france.39.t: "Successful Premiere"
 lr_france.39.d: "The premiere on the ruins of Orleans City Hall is perfect! very successful! Although no one applauded ... this was not the case after the black saint who was hidden in the audience randomly burned to death, everyone began to applaud, for this almost unknown shit movie, "The plot that Jeanne d'Arc killed everyone in Hundred Years War is just bullshit..."One person finally couldn't help but stop applauding, and then he was taken away by the secret police and tied to the torture rack."
 lr_france.39.a: ""It was so good! Why are there complaints?!""   
 lr_france.40.t: "In the Shadow"
 lr_france.40.d: ""Never let this lunatic continue to run rampant!" "Must kill her!" "And the Italian guy!!! It was the bastard who led the so-called renovation of Notre Dame!" A few in the basement of a Parisian cafe The French indignantly poured out their hatred of the current powers. For this reason, they let go of everything in the past. Both the socialists towards Moscow and the royalist party that led the retro movement were united, but the meeting was evolving into outrage."
 lr_france.40.a: ""Kill that Lunatic!""  
 lr_france.40.b: ""No more words, action tommorrow!""  
 lr_france.41.t: "Successful Raid"
 lr_france.41.d: "There have been several "secret rallies" that have been destroyed by Francisca-led remediation operations recently, erm ... Although most of them are just civilians venting their dissatisfaction, this is still unforgivable! The new order of the Black Virgin is perfect and cannot be questioned by anyone, and now these people will all be put on fire and burned to death."
 lr_france.41.a: ""I started to change my mind towards that bitch!!""  
 lr_france.42.t: "Action Preparation"
 lr_france.42.d: "Finally, after not knowing how many quarrels, the participants finally decided to rush into Orleans! Kill the crazy woman! But what about weapons? The bloodthirsty lunatics under the mad women showed their unique high efficiency, and almost all the arms in France were taken away."
 lr_france.42.a: ""I used to be an arms dealer!""   
 lr_france.43.t: "Before the Action"
 lr_france.43.d: ""I was thinking in the past, when she was just a rural bandit, thinking about why she destroyed France so persistently, or who is she?" "Is this important?" The arms dealer who is distributing weapons as if he had become the leader of this squad, he seemed uninterested in the speech of the young man. "Of course it is important, sir, do you know where she came from?""
 lr_france.43.a: ""It's true that I really don't know, who of you know?""
 lr_france.44.t: "Sudden big discussion"
 lr_france.44.d: "What exactly is the Black Virgin? No one seemed to be able to answer this question. She was like a whirlwind sweeping around the area of Orleans, gathering a group of potential death row criminals to kill and set fire. There are many slogans, and the content is nothing more than "burning France", so she should be a guy with a deep hatred against France. Is she Jeanne's reincarnation? But isn't the real Jeanne there? So, some kind of "Homunculus" did the Germans make to destroy us?"
 lr_france.44.a: ""Fuck it! Don't think about killing her tomorrow!"" 
 lr_france.45.t: "The assassination plot was foiled"
 lr_france.45.d: "There have been several "secret rallies" that have been destroyed by Francesca-led remediation operations. Although most of them are just civilians who are venting their dissatisfaction, there are special ones! The secret police found armed people gathered during a routine inspection of a coffee shop in Paris. After the fierce exchange of fire, we paid a lot of casualties to wipe them out, but unfortunately these people did not have to go to the fire."
 lr_france.45.a: ""I started to change my mind towards that bitch!!""  
 lr_france.46.t: "Proclaim our new order"
 lr_france.46.d: "Almost all organized resistance movements have been destroyed under our series of iron fist policies. Marshal Gilles de Rais and Francesca even complained that the castles in the entire territory are not enough. Now that the French either start to support us or have despaired about reality and can only support us, then it is time to start a real career! First of all, we will stand in the world with a new name!"
 lr_france.46.a: "Royal director Artaud suggested keeping the name of France and calling it the pioneer."  
 lr_france.46.b: "The Black Virgin insisted on erasing France, in the name of the dragon."  
 lr_france.47.t: "Question"
 lr_france.47.d: ""By the way, Jill, did you really check the origin of the Black Virgin?" Francisca rarely asked questions about things, and this question is definitely going to come. Sure enough, the mad marshal stopped the gratuitous dance, closed the book and thoughtfully stayed for a long time. "I really don't know where she came from. When I met her she was like this now, in the countryside of Orleans ... I honestly never thought about where she came from? Anyway you and I The ideal is gradually being realized ... or ... Plerati, why don't you ask why we are in this era? ""
 lr_france.47.a: ""Ahaha! I'm over worried."" 
 lr_france.48.t: "Find Collaborator"
 lr_france.48.d: "At the suggestion of the German consultant, Lord Black Virgin took the means of enveloping the French, and soon some activists stood out among the collaborators. Far-rightist Jacques Doriot, an ex-communist and Pierre Raval, a politician known for flattering Germany before the Kingdom is retored, was their representative. The two men were appointed Ministers of the Interior and Prime Minister after sworn allegiance to the Black Virgin and the highest German leader far from Berlin."
 lr_france.48.a: ""Work hard, or die.""
 lr_france.49.t: "Back to time before the restoration?"
 lr_france.49.d: "Dorio and Raval quickly summoned a large number of politicians from the time of the original French Republic. Their composition is still quite messy. There are right-wingers and left-wingers in the past. This is not important to us. Anyway, It is enough for them to be willing to "rebuild the country" under the eyes of the Black Virgin and the Germans."
 lr_france.49.a: ""They are professional in this respect.""
 lr_france.50.t: "Drafting a new constitution?"
 lr_france.50.d: "Gradually, we are now more and more like a "France", it seems that this is a little against the original intention of the Black Lady, France has not been destroyed ... how could it be? Wouldn't it be more fun to let them under German rule than to destroy them? So now Laval presents a document, he hopes to establish a dictatorship that upholds the three principles of "working family, motherland", then the name of the country will be changed to a relatively formal "France", this maybe..."
 lr_france.50.a: ""It doesn't matter, you could remain a name.""
 lr_france.50.b: ""France? Do you dare to mention it?"" 
 lr_france.51.t: "A self-defeat..."
 lr_france.51.d: "The first motorized division of the "French Thuleschutztruppe" led by Jacques Doriot has been completed. Today this force will be inspected by the Cabinet in Orleans, only when Prime Minister Laval is speaking to the soldiers on behalf of the Cabinet. In an accident, a soldier raised the Mauser rifle in his hand and turned the trigger against him. Until now, Laval, who was sent to Germany for first aid, was out of danger, and the perpetrators were executed by the Black Lady on the spot. Afterwards, Doriot was forced to conduct a political review of all soldiers and stopped all training programs."
 lr_france.51.a: ""It's a real waste.""
 lr_france.52.t: "German worker attacked"
 lr_france.52.d: "Recently, there have been many vicious incidents around the German workers 'camps in my country. Many workers in the camps were attacked in urban areas and in the wild after get off work. There were dozens of serious incidents that caused deaths. Maybe we should continue to introduce security forces from Germany, otherwise we cannot maintain the stability of the entire French land with our troops loyal to us, and cooperation with Germany is impossible to talk about then."
 lr_france.52.a: ""Request some polices from them?""  
 lr_france.53.t: "Investigation report sent to Himmler"
 lr_france.53.d: "... It seems that as you thought, the brainwashing of the two Joan of Arc clones in the early years can be said to be a complete failure, and the defective product that never grew up lost all its memories. This one who works with us is also based on his inner thoughts rather than psychological hints. In short, it is not a bad thing to continue such cooperation. Although her country is not completely controlled by us, there is no reason to oppose us. I personally recommend that you do not instruct Old Man Einzberen to clone foreign dignitaries. Regarding the current situation as if it could be reproduced at will. Oh, and be careful not to let Miss Alice touch the core of the experiment, and remember to close the cultivation tank. ———— Your loyal Rhinehard Heidrich"
 lr_france.53.a: ""Let this secret die forever""  
 lr_france.54.t: "Loyal French Thuleschutztruppe"
 lr_france.54.d: "After the last vicious incident, Dorio once again formed the second armoured grenadier division of the "French Thuleschutztruppe". This time, after carefully selecting the political qualities of the soldiers, no one finally shot at the rostrum. Then, the soldiers held their heads up and their morale was uplifted, ready to fight side by side with the German allies under the command of the Black Virgin."
 lr_france.54.a: ""It finally looks a bit correct."" 
 lr_france.55.t: "Liberate Colonies"
 lr_france.55.d: "We had no interest in the colonies, and the colonial government did not take a stand in the Civil War. It's time to direct rule from Orleans."
 lr_france.55.a: ""Demand them to obey""  
 lr_france.56.t: "Demands from Orlean"
 lr_france.56.d: "Orleans ordered us to dissolve government institutions and obey them completely, which may not be a good idea. The colonies are now packed with politicians and generals of the former kingdom, who are not going to do so."
 lr_france.56.a: ""Seek help from King of Britain""   
 lr_france.56.b: ""We have no other choices""   
 lr_france.57.t: "Call from French colonies"
 lr_france.57.d: "France, which was in power, seemed to be trying to consolidate its rule over the colonies recently, while the ousted royal government had shown us a willingness to form an "British-French United Kingdom" that would now leave the colonies of West Africa and the Indo-Chinese peninsula to us, and that in the future we would be able to begin the domination across the Straits if we defeated the demons of Orleans."
 lr_france.57.a: "At least we are in agreement against lunatics."   
 lr_france.57.b: "We are not going to provoke..."    
 lr_france.58.t: "They refused"
 lr_france.58.d: "We have no choices"
 lr_france.58.a: "This is our destiny"   
 lr_france.59.t: "Arrest Prelati"
 lr_france.59.d: "We cannot tolerate this madwoman continuing to make deceptive speeches on our land! For national security and the safety of all mankind, this lunatic must stay in prison!"
 lr_france.59.a: "Successful arrest"   
 lr_france.60.t: "Prelati committed suicide"
 lr_france.60.d: "Perhaps some human rights people will be slightly dissatisfied. Prelati, who was arrested and imprisoned a week ago, died suddenly. Forensic investigation revealed that she left a lot of strange symbols in the cell and pierced the carotid artery with a sharpened spoon. At present, this matter has been spread."
 lr_france.60.a: "It's okay if this guy is dead."  

 lr_france.61.t: "Be careful about French lunatic"
 lr_france.61.d: "Crazy French are deploying troops on our borders, we must beware of them!"
 lr_france.61.a: "Understood."   

 lr_france.62.t: "Statutory Arson Day"
 lr_france.62.d: ""Burn! Burn! Burn!! Burn it for me at this time of the year!" After the order was issued, this day of the year was an "arson day". Every resident under our rule had to light his own house. Must be so. So after encountering some resistance, the Black Virgin personally put the first fire on Notre Dame de Paris. The blue beard and Plerati's men followed up, and soon the entire France was shrouded in flames."
 lr_france.62.a: "Burn and change a name"  
 lr_france.63.t: "Germans have run!"
 lr_france.63.d: ""Jeanne d'Arc, I don't know why you are doing this. The Germans have taken control of all aspects of us. You are all done with this.""

 fn.1.t: "Project PN-196"
 fn.1.d: "Clouds gathered in the sky, a rustling cold wind surrounded the houses, Bretagne had been gloomy these days, and the heavy low pressure was almost breathless. Duke Richelieu, the minister of the navy, stepped into the door of the design bureau conference room in black leather boots, hurriedly took off his coat and high military cap, and hung it on the coat hanger at the door. Several senior Admiralty officials and design bureau engineers in the room sat around the oval table, waiting for the meeting to begin. "20 years after the end of World War I, the French navy has never been like this -" Richelieu paused, slightly closing his eyes and glancing at the crowd. "awkward." "as you already know, Italy is building a new battleship, Venetto, equipped with nine 15-inch main guns, while Bismarck, which the Germans are preparing, is said to be equipped with 15-inch guns. What about us? Not long ago, the Dunkerque had just been launched, the No. 2 turret of the Strasbourg had not been installed, and main guns of these two ships were only 330mm. If it goes on like this, not to mention being on an equal footing with the British, even the Mediterranean will lose control. That's what I came back from Indochina last month to solve. I've met with Queen Mary, who supports the navy's expansion plan, and the Ministry of Finance has approved funding under the project code PN-196. So your task today is to find a feasible new capital ship programme to regain French hegemony in the Mediterranean. ""
 fn.1.a: "g~o~o~d~~~~~~~~~"

 fn.2.t: "Project PN-196——Select Hull"
 fn.2.d: ""The first thing to be sure is the hull, whether it is a battleship or a battlecruiser. What do you think? “ “Battleships are the main force in future naval battles, and now it is obvious that our capital ships must be able to effectively protect against attacks by 15-inch guns. If this standard is not met, our front lines will become fragile in a decisive battle. An Admiralty official said slowly, "first of all, we must figure out what our strategic purpose is."Another naval officer stood up and went to the huge map of Europe hanging on the wall. "We are not going to fight a decisive battle at sea with the large-scale British fleet, our main purpose is to control the Mediterranean and attack the maritime lines of Italy. Only the capital ships with high speed can achieve this goal. In addition, our ships have to face the threat of torpedoes and aircraft, which also reflects the necessity of high speed. And now that our country's finances are tight, the relatively cheap battlecruisers are the most suitable choice. Current technology can completely achieve high-speed battleships, as long as the layout is reasonable." "Have you forgotten the lesson of the Battle of Jutland? " Another general retorted. The discussion became more and more heated, and in the end, the consensus was that--"
 fn.2.a: "Battleship"

 fn.3.t: "Project PN-196——Main Battery"
 fn.3.d: ""Considering the current situation, we should also choose the caliber of the 15-inch main gun. The most critical problem is that there are now two layout schemes: one is to continue to use the Dunkerque-class two front quadruple batteries, and the other is to return to the traditional three triple batteries. ""The advantage of the quadruple main gun is that the firepower is further concentrated, the main armor belt is effectively shortened, and the weight of the ship is greatly reduced, so more remaining design weight can be used for the power part and the air defense part. The defect is that the technology of our quadruple turret is not very mature, and its reliability will be affected to a certain extent. at the same time, the distance between the guns is too close, and the wakes interfere with each other when the projectile comes out of the chamber, resulting in trajectory deviation and increasing the walking surface. And because there are only two turrets, if one is destroyed in battle, the combat effectiveness of the whole ship will be greatly reduced. To solve this problem, armored bulkheads need to be set up in the quadruple main turret to divide the turret into the left and right parts. The Dunkerque design verified that this scheme is effective." An engineer explained the technical details in detail."
 fn.3.a: "Quadruple Battery"

 fn.4.t: "Project PN-196——Projectile"

 fn.13.d: "With the formal start of the development of the weapons of the No. 1 warship of the PN-196 program, more and more problems are gradually exposed. The most serious problem is that the elevation angle of the 152mm  secondary gun used in the No. 1 warship can not reach 90 degrees of the predetermined target, and after the efforts of a large number of engineers, it can only reach 75 degrees at most. On the other hand, the elastic loading system matched with it is not mature, and the ROF is low, but it can not be maintained. At the same time, the rotation and pitching speed of the turret is not up to standard, so it is impossible to track fast-moving air targets. These problems meant that the gun could not complete the scheduled air defense mission, causing the six new 37mm automatic anti-aircraft guns of the No. 1 ship to become the only medium-range air defense weapons. Weak air defense capability has become the deadliest weakness of the new first-class capital ship. In order to make up for these defects, for the No. 2 warship that is about to start, we must find a way to modify the original design as soon as possible. Duke Richelieu has summoned Admiralty officials and Design Bureau engineers to discuss improvements to the No. 2 ship. Time is running out, it is difficult for us to make major changes to the overall layout, we can only change some local designs, starting with secondary guns and anti-aircraft guns."

The gun uses barrel self-tightening technology, semi-automatic loading, elastic impact loading to achieve arbitrary angle loading. The twin guns share a set of pitching devices with a pitch angle of-10 to 80 degrees and fire integrated ammunition. High explosive projectiles equipped with timing fuzes and semi-armor-piercing projectiles against light targets at close range can be used with a firing speed of 10 rounds per minute.

According to the data provided by the Luenavale Artillery Research Institute, the cyclic firing rate of a single gun can reach 165172 rounds per minute. To protect the complex ammunition supply structure, they designed a dual gun seat with an open circular arc cover and introduced an RPC system to control the azimuth, which uses electricity to drive the gun seat rotation, which is the first time in the world, although the gun pitch still has to be manually controlled. Unfortunately, the development of the gun has not yet been completed, only 2 sets of samples have been produced in the workshop, and there are still many problems. According to the current progress, it is estimated that the No. 1 ship will not be equipped with this kind of anti-aircraft gun. instead, we will probably have to install the old semi-automatic 37mm/50 CAIL Model 1933 anti-aircraft gun on the No. 1 ship.

Index: except for the improvement part, the other indexes are basically the same as those of the No. 1 warship. The boiler test shows that the transmission system of No. 1 and No. 2 warships is efficient and reliable, but the deficiency is that when the engine is running at medium and low power, the energy conversion rate of the engine is relatively low. therefore, the fuel consumption of economic speed is larger and the endurance is poor.

Since the Navy wanted to start the construction of the No. 3 ship as soon as the No. 1 ship was launched, the Duke finally chose the A2 case, which was questioned, as the basis for the design of the No. 3 ship. The improved B3 TER project was selected as the basis for the design of the No. 4 warship with relatively plenty of time. The final design of the No. 3 warship continues the layout of the A2 case, which is similar to that of the No. 1 warship as a whole, and mainly adjusts the layout of secondary guns. The improvements are as follows: keep the secondary gun, cancel one secondary turret at the stern and change it to two knapsack layouts. This ingenious design provides additional control space for the new anti-aircraft gun and limits the weight gain to only about 50 tons. After the removal of the four twin 100mm turrets on both sides of the tower, the remaining two 100mm turrets are lightened to ensure that the weight of the superstructure does not exceed the standard, and after it is moved to the No. 2 main turret, the number of 37mm anti-aircraft guns remains unchanged, but the position is adjusted accordingly. However, this design relatively limits the firing range of the No. 2 main turret, which will be reduced from 286 degrees to 278 degrees when the two anti-aircraft guns are fired. On the other hand, all new 100mm guns are equipped with 30mm armour to protect against shrapnel and muzzle storms. In addition, minor adjustments are made to the front armor of each secondary gun to offset the increase in the center of gravity brought about by the knapsack layout."

 fn.11.t: "The No. 4 ship"
 fn.11.d: "The B3 ter programme is an almost brand-new design and has been widely praised by the Admiralty. Its innovation lies in the average placement of the two main turrets at the front and rear of the ship, making up for the firepower behind the ship. The front 2 and rear 1 of the secondary gun is arranged on the central axis, which can also provide the firepower of 9 doors on one side. Both 100mm anti-aircraft guns and 37mm anti-aircraft guns have increased from 6 to 8. All anti-aircraft guns are installed on the side of the open firing boundary, which is far away from each other, and each group is controlled by a controller, so that there is less interference with each other, and the efficiency of air defense is significantly improved. The front two knapsack layout 152mm secondary guns can also provide strong support for the forward direction of the greater threat of torpedo strikes. The armored area of the whole ship is only less than 4 meters longer than the No. 1 ship, and thanks to a reasonable layout, the weight has been reduced by 360 tons. The final design scheme of the No. 4 warship follows the basic layout of the B3 ter case, but the difference lies in that the catapult is moved back to the stern, the layout of the new battleship of the US military is adopted, and the hangar is placed longitudinally inside the ship, which solves the problem that the firing of the original main gun affects the anti-aircraft gun. The protection of the secondary gun is further strengthened compared with the No. 3 ships and the front, side, top, and gun seat armor have been improved to a certain extent. As the secondary turret is reduced by 1 compared with the No. 3 warship, the exposed chimney above the main deck is also allowed to enhance protection from 20mm to 30mm. As a result of the increase in air defense weapons, the number of small boats of the No. 4 ship has been reduced from 17 to 12 compared with that of the No. 3 ship."

The new warship selects the 3x4 joint main gun design in plan 3, using the 'front 2 and rear 1' layout, which greatly increases the firepower delivery compared with the 'Richelieu' class. On the other hand, the firing speed of 12 guns is faster than that of 8 guns.

Thanks to the extension of the hull, the side is equipped with the newly developed 100mm/55 Model 1940  dual-purpose gun, which can be regarded as a growth version of model 1933. The barrel uses a self-tightening integral type, with a semi-automatic sliding wedge locking machine, the firing speed, range, and power have been improved, and the number has increased from 8 to 12, divided into front and rear groups arranged on both sides of the ship.

 fn_news.11.d: "The naval battle of the Norwegian fjord is a large-scale pursuit battle between Germany and France in Norwegian waters. Due to intelligence errors, the whereabouts of the aircraft carrier Joffre and the 17th escort formation escorted by it were detected by Nordic reconnaissance aircraft patrolling the sea. Germany immediately sent a large number of bombers and several ships in an attempt to destroy the aircraft carrier. Although Joffre sent three groups of fighters to intercept, the escort of German aircraft made it impossible for French fighters to take into account the bomber fleet. The first round of airstrikes flew over the Joffre, and under the ship's flexible evasion, the German attack did not work, but a destroyer escorted was hit by a torpedo and sank. The Naval Command received a request for help from the captain of the 'Joffre' and found that the only battleship that could arrive in the nearby sea area in a short time was the battleship Alsace, which happened to pass by this area while returning to Hong Kong to refuel after the mission. After receiving the order of reinforcements, the battleship Alsace resolutely went to the rescue and successfully arrived before the second round of airstrikes. At the beginning of the air raid, the powerful air defense firepower of 'Alsace' immediately shot down several dive bombers, and the dense fire network composed of dozens of anti-aircraft guns caught the German plane off guard and made it difficult to approach. On the other hand, the German ship was surprised to find that a battleship had joined the battlefield and mistakenly thought that French reinforcements had arrived, so it decided to give up the pursuit. In the end, the carrier "Joffre" successfully broke away from the battlefield. After the war, French Admiral Darren commented, "Alsace's rescue operation was decisive and brave. Your heroic battle helped your companions return to their homeland. Congratulations on your glorious achievements.""

 fn.100.d: "Soon after the PN-196 proposal was put forward, some Admiralty officials proposed to the Duke of Richelieu whether it was possible to bypass the London Naval Treaty and secretly build a super battleship to gain an overwhelming advantage over the German and Italian navies, or to counteract the quantitative superiority of the British navy by virtue of quality, and a few of the proposals even had the idea of equipped with a 17-inch main gun. At that time, the Duke of Richelieu rejected these proposals on the grounds that it was not appropriate to violate international conventions and damage France's international reputation. However, when French intelligence personnel learned that Germany was secretly preparing the 'H' plan, Navy Minister Richelieu could no longer ignore the potential threat and immediately met with Admiral Darren, Defense Minister Bradamante, Prime Minister Leo B Harvey, and others to discuss coping strategies, and finally came up with the plan to build a new first-class battleship, which was later known as the 'Alsace' class battleship. What was unknown at the time, however, was that there was a secret backup plan in addition to the plan, which was approved by the Supreme Council and signed by Queen Marie herself. Of the financial allocation in 1940, 5.6 billion francs was the "wartime emergency reserve", which was officially used for the procurement of German and French war equipment, but the real whereabouts of the money was known to only a few people at that time. And finally gave birth to the shocking 'République' class battleships."

 fn.103.d: "The secretly built new ship is required to carry new 431mm guns and adopt a two-seat quadruple layout of "one before and after". With a total weight of more than 4000 tons, the new gun is the heaviest turret in the world. The rotation of the turret and the pitching of the barrel are driven by electricity and hydraulic pressure, and the firing is directly controlled by the RPC system controlled by the central fire control system. The two guns on both sides of the turret have independent ammunition depots and projectile lifting mechanisms, which can be pitched independently, and there are also two 90mm artillery firing flares on both sides of each turret to enhance the night combat capability. The hooded armor-piercing projectile weighs 1320 kilograms and is 200cm long, which is longer than the overweight projectile used by American battleships. The super-long projectile gives it excellent aerodynamic shape, making the trajectory farther and more stable. The SD23' propellant, which weighs up to 364kg per shot, enables the projectile to reach an initial velocity of 810m / s, giving it the world's strongest vertical armor erosion and the longest range. In actual tests, the gun eroded 582mm of vertical armor at 20000 (30000) meters. However, the high charge also shortens the life of the gun barrel, about 190 rounds. In order to alleviate the influence of the muzzle storm of the 4-equipped main gun on walking, the gun is equipped with a 0.06-second delay firing device, which allows the first and third guns to fire first, and a gyro stabilizer is installed at the same time, which significantly reduces the gun walk. the improved projectile system also enables the firing speed to reach 2.2 rounds per minute, which is the same as that of the American-made 16-inch naval gun."

 fn.104.d: "The protection of the new ship requires that it can resist the attack of its own 431mm artillery at a distance of 20km. The specific design is as follows: the main armor belt is 410mm, the lower end is thinned to 260mm and 19 degrees tilt, and a layer of 24mm anti-collapse lining is added. The horizontal protection consists of three layers, the first layer is the 36mm deck armor, the second layer is the 170mm main horizontal armor belt, the top of the ammunition depot is 190mm, and the third layer is the downward sloping extended 40mm armor. The protection of the main turret is 584mm in the front and 305mm in the side, the top 232mm is equipped with 170mm armor, the rear end is 250mm, and the seat ring is 533mm. The secondary turret protection adopts the design of Gascogne, and the armor of the command tower is 350mm. Underwater protection is still the focus of the armor protection of the new ship. there is a triple bottom protection in the armored area, and several torpedo protection compartments and watertight compartments with armor are set up.

Thanks to the efforts of many engineers, the new 152mm/55 Model 1942 has finally solved these problems. The new gun can achieve an elevation of up to 85 degrees, the improved elastic loading system increases the firing speed to 6 rounds/min, the turret is powered by two Walter-Leonardo generators, the pitching rate of the gun body is increased to 8 degrees per second, and the rotation rate is 12 degrees per second. The gun is commanded by a new millimeter-wave air defense fire control radar and RPC and is equipped with a variety of projectiles. The new anti-aircraft bomb is equipped with a proximity fuze, which greatly improves the lethality of the aircraft. The initial speed of the gun is 870 m/s when using armor-piercing projectiles and 900 m/s when using anti-aircraft projectiles. The new ship is expected to be equipped with nine new 152mm secondary guns and three combined 'front, second and rear' knapsack layout, similar to the Gascogne design."

 fn.106.d: "Because the performance of the 100mm/45 Model 1933  dual-purpose gun equipped by the 'Richelieu' class battleship has lagged behind that of the US-made mk12 naval gun, to further strengthen the long-range air defense firepower, the new ship plans to use the new 127mm/54 anti-aircraft gun. The gun adopts a double-mounted CAD, turret with a rotation speed of 25 degrees per second, and is equipped with a vertical wedge semi-automatic latch and an electric projectile rod to be loaded with a lifting machine. it can be filled at any angle and the firing speed is as high as 20 rounds per minute. Because the double diameter is larger than the American 127mm mk12 naval gun, the initial velocity of the projectile can reach 870m/ s, the range is longer, the trajectory is more stable, and the lethality is stronger. When carrying out the air defense mission, the gun is guided by the new air defense fire control radar and commanded by the RPC system and fires a high explosive bomb of a radio proximity fuze with a maximum range of 12000 meters at an elevation of 70 degrees, so that it can effectively intercept high-speed flying targets at speeds of up to 800km/h. When firing armor-piercing projectiles against ships, the initial velocity is 855m/s, and the maximum range is 18000 meters. Extremely high firing speed and accuracy can also cause great damage to small and medium-sized warships close by. On the other hand, due to the increase in the weight and volume of 127mm  dual-purpose guns, the new ship is expected to be equipped with 16 guns of this type, with eight double assemblies divided into front and rear four groups arranged on both sides of the ship's hull, one for each group under the command of one fire control radar."

The new anti-aircraft gun is designed to be 57mm Compact 60 and is installed in a twin-mounted ACAD with a total turret weight of 18 tons. The cannon uses 2.96kg (6.5lb) heavy projectiles with an initial velocity of 850m / s, a firing speed of 120m / min, a maximum range of 14500 m and a maximum range of 5500 m at a muzzle elevation of 90 degrees. The new ship is planned to be equipped with 24 anti-aircraft guns of this type, of which 8 double-assembled ACAD are arranged on both sides of the front and rear secondary guns, and 4 of them are arranged on the inside of the front and rear 127mm  dual-purpose guns.

Besides, two 8-meter-long OPL stereo double-diameter rangefinders were installed next to the fire control system of the front tower and on the rear tower as a backup for the main rangefinder, and three 8-meter OPL stereo double-diameter rangefinders were installed on three 152mm secondary guns for use. To enhance the accuracy of radar fire control, the new ship plans to install two ACAE radars to guide long-range air defense artillery and an ABM fire control radar to guide the main gun on the firing system of the front tower. The installation of DRBV- 10 water surface detection radar above the command tower, DRBV- 30 navigation radar at the top of the mainmast, and DRBV- 20 air surveillance radar at the top of the rear main mast proved to be very effective within a range of 25000 meters."

After several battles, Admiral Jean de Laborde, commander of the Northern Joint Fleet, had to order the dispatch of only a few major ships in the North Sea, such as the battlecruiser Dunkerque, to escort the important fleet, and it must be admitted that this is a huge waste of the main force of the French Northern Fleet. Admiral Laborde pointed out that if the German heavy cruiser team uses night warfare to attack our aircraft carrier formation at high speed, it will be very difficult for our escort ships to ensure the safety of aircraft carriers. Because of this situation, the Minister of the Navy, Duke Richelieu, once again put forward the idea of large cruiser. This new type of warship has both the powerful firepower of a battleship and the high speed of a heavy cruiser, which is enough to defeat the Scharnhorst class battlecruiser. At the same time, the heavy cruiser formation of the other side can be hunted and killed, and even if it encounters the battleship, it can quickly get out of the battlefield at high speed.

The gun has a caliber of 305mm (12 inches) and is a reduced version of the new 380mm/50 main gun equipped by the 'Alsace' class battleship. the structure of the gun body and the double diameter of the barrel is the same. The barrel tightening gun body is composed of an inner bore tube, an equal length reinforcement layer, and a rear three-layer quilt barrel, and there are two locking rings and a screw latch with a hydraulic switch at the end of the gun. The armor-piercing projectile fired by the gun weighs 508kg and has an initial speed of 890m/s. It can pierce 354mm vertical armor at a distance of 20km. The new ship plans to install three-four combined turrets, each weighing 1120 tons, with a maximum elevation of 35 degrees, and a maximum range of 41000 meters at 35 degrees, the same as the Alsace class scheme. the improved loading system can achieve an average firing rate of 3 rounds per minute and a barrel life of 300 rounds. According to the updated main gun design standard of the French Navy, all-new turrets are equipped with 0.06 second delayed firing devices and gyro stabilizers, and the firing is directly controlled by the RPC system and the central fire control system. Compared with the Dunkerque class, the ship's 12 305mm guns greatly increase the firing speed and firepower delivery, which shows the difference in positioning between her and the Dunkerque class, the former is completely designed for the Scharnhorst class and hunting cruisers."

To reduce weight, the secondary turret protection is lightweight and the front is reduced from the Richelieu class 130mm to the 116mm. The front and top of the command tower armor are 300mm and 130mm respectively.

The military had expected to build a regular aircraft carrier with a standard displacement of 25000 tons in the late 1930s, drawing on the operational experience of the Béarn. However, because France's imaginary enemy, Germany, was restricted by the Versailles Peace Treaty, bound by the Washington Naval Treaty, and France's financial difficulties, the French Navy gave up building aircraft carriers. Until 1936, the French navy still had only one aircraft carrier, and the ship also found many defects in its operation for many years, and the vigorous development of aircraft carriers by the United States and Japan also made the French navy gradually realize the important position of carriers in future naval warfare. As Germany became more and more disobedient to the Versailles treaty, the French navy began to reconsider the ship-building plan of the new aircraft carrier, and they put forward two options: one is to convert the original Ducken-class cruiser into a light carrier; the other is to build two 18000-ton neutral aircraft carriers. However, when the French authorities learned not long ago that the German navy had begun to build a Zeppelin class aircraft carrier, they immediately abandoned their previous idea and decided to start building a truly large aircraft carrier to counter Germany's actions and regain maritime superiority, codenamed 'PA-16''."

As the development of the new 37mm full-automatic anti-aircraft gun by the Luenavale Artillery Research Institute has not been successful, if the research and development of the gun is not completed on time, the old semi-automatic 37mm/50 CAIL Model 1933 anti-aircraft gun will be used instead. With the progress of radar technology, the detection capability has been improved by leaps and bounds. like the planned new battleship, the ship uses fire control radar to assist in detecting targets, uses fire controllers to calculate the parameters of distance, speed, and altitude, and guides anti-aircraft guns to aim automatically. This advanced RPC system is used for the first time in the world."

 fn_news.19.d: "Shortly after the final design was confirmed, the Saint-Nazaire Pennholt Shipyard received an intention contract from the French Navy for three Joffre class aircraft carriers. The placement of the keel of the first ship 'Joffre' began soon, but due to the shortage of large docks in China, after the launch of 'Joffre', the construction of the No. 2 ship 'Pandraway' could begin in the same dock, as did the construction plan of No. 3 ship 'Pétain'. The Joffre was launched under the auspices of Admiral Jean de LaPolde, a pioneer of French naval aviation and a former captain of France's first aircraft carrier, the Beyain. After several months of trial voyage, the 'Joffre' was incorporated into the second Special mixed formation of the French Northern Joint Fleet and deployed at the naval base of Calais. During this period, she participated in several important maritime military exercises, accumulating valuable experience for the tactical command and operation of the French naval air force, and it was precisely in these exercises that the French naval air force established the established standard of the aviation brigade, which consists of 30 fighters, 36 dive bombers (divided into two squadrons) and 18 torpedo bombers. The experience of modern naval warfare shows that compared with battleships, aircraft carriers have unparalleled advantages in mobility, reconnaissance capability and large-scale attack capability. Can she replace the battleship as the new core of the fleet? People will wait and see."

 fn.34.d: "The situation between Germany and France is extremely tense, and the possibility of war has increased sharply. While reviewing the shipbuilding plan, Duke Richelieu, the minister of the navy, found that the number of French naval aircraft carriers was too small and that the new fleet aircraft carriers might not be in service for a long time. So she asked for the rapid expansion of a number of light aircraft carriers based on the hull of cruisers. As a result, the French navy accelerated the design of new heavy aircraft carriers on the one hand and began to study light aircraft carriers the size of cruisers on the other. Although designers have proposed that this modified aircraft carrier will have many safety and seaworthiness restrictions, such as re-laying the hangar deck above the original deck of the cruiser will raise the ship's center of gravity and cause lack of stability, the weak hangar armor will cause hidden dangers to the hangar and hull strength, and the narrow flight deck will make it more difficult for carrier-based aircraft to take off and land, but the dangerous situation does not allow any hesitation. Soon Queen Mary ordered approval to convert six of the Bayard class light cruisers being developed and planned for construction into light aircraft carriers. Concentrate your wisdom and overcome difficult problems.' The Duke Richelieu said in a letter of encouragement to designers."

 fn.35.t: "Hull modification"
 fn.35.d: "The preliminary design of B.S.E.B is to add an integrated island and a relatively narrow hangar to the 'Bayard' class light cruiser under development, re-lay a relatively short hangar deck above the original deck of the cruiser, and change the bow to a closed design. Hangars, flight decks and islands mean a significant increase in the weight of the upper hull, resulting in a significant increase in the center of gravity. In order to solve this problem, the Navy decided to set up torpedo protection protrusions on both sides of the slender hull of the original cruiser, which can not only increase the buoyancy and stability of the ship, but also set up heavy oil tanks inside it to increase the endurance of the warship. at the same time, it can also enhance the ability to resist torpedo attacks. The modified light aircraft carrier is equipped with two lifts, which are arranged before and after the hangar, and equipped with a hydraulic catapult. In terms of armor protection, the 130mm waterline armor of the original cruiser can provide effective protection against 152mm guns, but in order to reduce the weight of the upper part of the ship, the hangar armor is thin, only 50mm, and the flight deck is made of wood with a layer of very light armor attached to it. The level of underwater protection is to add a torpedo protection bag on the basis of the original cruiser, which can defend against the attack of air-dropped torpedo to a certain extent. The power system uses six Andre boilers and four turbine engines, which can provide 100000hp for the aircraft carrier."

Besides, 10 double-mounted 20mm anti-aircraft guns are installed throughout the hull to form a tight short-range air defense network. On the shipboard electrical system, the ship is equipped with a new type of surface detection radar with an accuracy of 300 yards and a resolution of 400 yards. it can detect large ships within 16 nautical miles or destroyers within 12 nautical miles, and the new air search radar can detect seaplanes at a height of 10000 feet within 70 nautical miles or fighters of similar height within 50 nautical miles."

 fn.30.t: "Heavy aircraft carrier expansion plan"
 fn.30.d: "The use of the Joffre class aircraft carrier made the French navy realize that the fragile part of the aircraft carrier mainly lies in the flight deck and lift, while the core of armored protection is the hangar. The unarmored flight deck is easy to be pierced by the aircraft bomb, which enters the hangar directly, which is very dangerous to the aircraft carrier, and after the flight deck is destroyed, the aircraft carrier cannot take off and land, and the aircraft carrier cannot fight. Although there is still a weak possibility of taking off and landing aircraft after the lift is destroyed, the combat capability of the aircraft carrier will also be greatly reduced. In order to deal with the attacks of a large number of land-based aircraft from Germany and Italy and improve the viability of aircraft carriers, the French navy decided to design a new class of heavily armored aircraft carriers with reference to the characteristics of British 'brilliant' class aircraft carriers. On the other hand, the prowess of aircraft carriers in the Atlantic Ocean has also made the Navy determined to speed up the construction of aircraft carriers. The combination of the two factors led to a new plan for the expansion of a large aircraft carrier. Thanks to the Queen's strong support, and following a fierce quarrel in the Supreme Council, the Navy finally won funding for four new aircraft carriers. In order to commemorate the great contribution made by Marshal Ferdinand Foch in World War I, Jeanne suggested that the first ship be named "Foch"."

 fn.31.t: "Hull"
 fn.31.d: "The Foch class follows the basic characteristics of the Joffre class, such as closed bow, integral island, all-pass flight deck, double hangar, etc., but the deck protection is greatly enhanced. The flight deck is directly involved in the hull composition, which is covered with 76mmCNC armor and reinforced with 114mm armor above the key ammunition depots, which enables the Fuxu class to withstand 1000-pound aerial bomb attacks. Of course, the heavy armor also brings a disadvantage, that is, the center of gravity is on the high side, and the stability of the hull has decreased, so the freeboard height of the ship is lower than that of Joffre class, to alleviate this problem. To ensure that the carrier-based aircraft have armored protection at the shortest take-off and landing distance, the ship does not use the front, middle and rear lift design, but uses two larger front and rear lifts. Not only maintain efficient take-off and landing efficiency but also different from the 'brilliant' class unprotected lift, the ship's lift is covered with two pieces of 25mm armor, which plays a certain role in protecting the fragile lift. Another design highlight of the ship's protection is that the hangar has storm discharge holes and detachable steel plates, which helps to alleviate the hull damage caused by the explosion of the armored aircraft carrier hangar. The waterline armor has also been strengthened to 114 mm to provide better protection for the hull. The underwater protection maintains the 'Joffre' design, and the torpedo protection bulkhead is slightly thickened. The ship plans to install four high-temperature steam turbines and six new supercharged boilers, capable of producing a power output of 150000 hp."

The barrel uses a self-tightening integral type, with a semi-automatic sliding wedge locking machine, and the firing speed, power, and range have been improved. Five are installed before and after the island, and three are installed on the port side, with a total of eight double-mounted 37 mm/70 models 1935 anti-aircraft guns. In addition, 20 dual-mounted 20 mm anti-aircraft guns are placed all over the ship's hull. For the first time, the Foch class began to use advanced microwave surface search radar with an accuracy of 200 yards and a resolution of 400 yards. It can detect low-altitude bombers below 500 feet within 15 nautical miles, battleships within 22 nautical miles, or destroyers within 15 nautical miles. At the same time, the installation of SM radar can search aircraft at an altitude of 10000 feet within 50 nautical miles and battleships within 25 nautical miles with an accuracy of 500 to 200 yards and a resolution of 200 yards. this radar is also the first batch of fighter deployment radar, which can effectively deploy fighters to intercept enemy aircraft, together with additional return signal devices, the ship's radar system has reached a very advanced level."

In several experimental landing operations, the French army found that although the main gun power of destroyers and light cruisers was less than that of heavy cruisers, their faster firing speed could form a firepower advantage on the other side in a short time, but it was more efficient than cruisers. To gain an overwhelming advantage over German heavy cruisers, the French navy decided to develop a new type of 240mm rapid-fire main gun. The new gun was originally planned to be installed on the St. Louis class heavy cruiser, but it was calculated that the new turret was so heavy that the ship's hull needed a major overhaul. Therefore, the French Navy decided to further develop the C5A3 and C5SA1 projects to give full play to the full effectiveness of the new artillery, code-named C6."

In the past, the sub-loading projectile used by naval guns is helpful to control the range and power, but the firing speed is too slow. To improve the firing speed, the new main gun adopts fixed loading and automatic loading system for the first time. The gun pitch and rotation are all electrically driven, which can be loaded at any angle and can be fired into the air. It uses an air tank to provide air pressure to open and close the latch. It takes only 8 seconds to load and can fire at an astonishing speed of 8 shots per minute. The gun is the first batch of artillery developed by the French navy to use sliding gaskets. The gun body uses a self-tightening integral type, the chrome-plated sliding gasket is fixed by a gasket locking ring, and the wedge-shaped vertical sliding tail block is used instead of the traditional intermittent screw. when using a heavy charge, the initial velocity of the projectile can reach 845m / s, and the maximum range can reach 36km at an elevation of 40 degrees. The new ship plans to be equipped with nine of this type of artillery, three combined with three pieces of artillery, and a layout of "front, second and rear one". Due to the use of a complex automatic loading system and thicker armor, the weight of the turret is significantly higher than that of the 'St. Louis' class, each weighing 730 tons. With the support of the advanced automatic loading system, the theoretical ammunition delivery capacity of the ship can reach a terrible 13 tons per minute, and its firepower is comparable to that of a battleship."

When firing at ships, it fires armor-piercing projectiles with an initial velocity of 855m / s and a maximum range of 18000 meters. In terms of medium-range air defense, the ship uses a more powerful 57mm/60 Model 1943 anti-aircraft gun to replace the original 37mm gun. The new anti-aircraft gun is installed in a double-mounted ACAD.

In order to solve this problem, the French navy decided to use compressed oxygen as combustion aid. The propellant burns in pure oxygen, which mainly produces slightly soluble carbon dioxide, so it is not easy to produce bubbles. As a result, the speed and range of the torpedo have also been greatly improved. the new 550mm oxygen torpedo can reach a maximum speed of 55 knots, with a range of 3000 meters, a range of 18 kilometers at 40 knots, and a maximum range of 30 kilometers at 35 knots. Due to the saving of propellant, the new torpedo charge has also been greatly improved, reaching 408 kg TNT, which is enough to cause serious damage to any enemy ship."

When the first Mogador-class destroyer was officially put into service, the confidence of admirals, the pride of researchers and workers, and the pride of the officers and men on board were the answers. The main gun of this destroyer has a firing speed of 12 rounds per minute and a speed of 43 knots! The tonnage has also reached 4000 tons of light cruiser grade! New fire control equipped with a new main gun, whether in the face of destroyers or cruisers, have a good performance. High mobility with the torpedo, making it a new French maritime sword, this kind of ship will seriously threaten the Italian sea supply line! That's right! Once again, the French are ahead of the Italians, and as the French say, Italy can only catch up with them!"

 fn.48.t: "Naval manoeuvre"
 fn.48.d: "The large-scale exercise is divided into two antagonistic fleets, one is a cutting-edge fleet with Béarn as the main force, and the other is a traditional fleet composed of battlecruiser Dunkerque. Among them, Béarn's excellent performance invigorated the Admiralty, whose aircraft broke through layer after layer of defense of the traditional fleet wheel array and directly "took" the flagship Dunkerque at the center of the enemy fleet. This incident made the French realize two things: first, the serious lack of anti-air firepower of France's existing ships; second, the importance of aircraft carriers to future naval warfare. When the French realized this, they found that they had already lagged behind Britain, the United States and Japan in these two aspects, in addition to stepping up the construction of new aircraft carriers and the study of new anti-air weapons, the transformation of old weapons is also a good way. The Navy thought of the De Grasse class, a new light cruiser that had not yet been finalized last year, and the design of the whole ship was nearing completion. Coupled with the experience of this large-scale exercise, part of De Grasse's blueprint design would be replanned."
 fn.48.a: "What kind of ship could it be?"

 fn.44.t: "De Grasse class hull"
 fn.44.d: "Because the ship is required to be designed under the framework of the London Naval Treaty, the displacement is strictly limited to less than 8000 tons, while the new ship is defined as an air defense cruiser, which is mainly used as the escort mission of the main ship, so the ship is only equipped with light armor protection. The specific design is as follows: the side waterline armored belt is 100mm, and the lower end is gradually weakened to 28mm. The horizontal protection is a single layer of 32mm dome belt covering the deck, with a layer of 32mm CNC armor attached to the ammunition depot. The front of the command tower is 75mm, and the front, side, top, rear, and seat ring of the main turret are all 32mm. Underwater protection maintains minimum double bottom protection, equipped with a torpedo compartment and many watertight compartments."
 fn.44.a: "Light protection"

 fn.49.t: "Weapons"
 fn.49.d: "De Grasse's initial design was 3x3 152mm main guns, but due to the lack of effective anti-air weapons, the naval department further strengthened the air defense design of Grasse. Considering that the anti-air performance of the 152mm main guns was poor and could not be competent for the outer anti-air network, the Navy Department unloaded all original 152mm guns, added one turret base, and the new main guns were 4x2 130mm/45 Mle 1935 dual-purpose guns. Due to the removal of the catapult, the number of secondary guns has been increased from 3x2 100mm/45 Mle 1930 anti-air guns to 6x2, and 6 new 37mm/70 Mle 1935 anti-air guns have been installed in the middle to replace 4 old semi-auto 37mm/50 guns, and the 13.2mm machine guns have been replaced by 24x1 20mm Oerlikon cannons, which greatly enhanced the air defense firepower."

 fn.50.t: "Final index"
 fn.50.d: "Because the ship is designed to be located in the middle air defense net of the wheel-shaped fleet, there is no torpedo between the eviction and the main ship, and the hull armor is also very weak, but its 8w hp engine can maintain a very high speed. Although the new design runs counter to the original design, the light cruiser provides anti-aircraft firepower, but the anti-aircraft cruiser does not seem to be a bad product, and the initial plan is still preserved, waiting for the right time. A brand new light cruiser will break its cocoon. The detailed indicators are as follows: length: 175.7m. Standard displacement: 8000 tons. Fully loaded displacement: 9600 tons. Main gun: 8 130mm/45 Mle 1935 artillery, 4x2 'front 2 rear 2' layout, theoretical firing rate 15 rounds / min. Secondary guns: 12 100mm/55 Model 1933  dual-purpose guns, 6x2, arranged on the inside of the front and rear main guns. Anti-aircraft guns: 12 37mm/70 Model 1935 anti-aircraft guns, 6x2 arranged on both sides. There are 24 20mm Oerlikon cannons, which are arranged all over the hull of the ship.

Unfortunately, however, the French light cruiser plan was interrupted by a large-scale exercise, and naval aircraft became the top priority of the French navy. The unfinished Grasse redesigned, the air defense performance of the initial design is really unflattering, and the new Grasse has become an air defense light cruiser, but this ship has weak firepower to the ship, and the maximum caliber is not even as good as the 36A destroyer being built by the Germans. Forced by the threat, the original Grasse design was brought out again. On the basis of the original, the new main gun has been replaced, and the firing speed of the gun has become the enhanced object of the main gun compared with the original Grasse design."

 fn.53.t: "Hull protection"
 fn.53.d: "The goal of the French navy is to design a large light cruiser with balanced firepower, protection, and maneuverability, and can be quickly built and deployed, so in the normal combat distance of the cruiser, it is very important to be able to effectively defend the artillery of the other side's light cruisers or destroyers. As the displacement of the ship is no longer restricted by naval treaties, better armor protection can be used, specifically designed as follows: waterline armor belt 130mm, the lower end weakened to 83mm; horizontal protection is 57mm deck armor, with 30mm partition armor attached to the top of the ammunition depot; the front of the main turret is 170mm, the side and top is 76mm, the rear 38mm, the seat ring 150mm, the front 130mm of the command tower, the top 57mm. The underwater protection is designed for the updated standard cruiser of the French navy, which adopts double bottom protection and sets up several independent torpedo compartments and watertight compartments, which is significantly stronger than the old cruisers."

 fn.52.t: "Weapons and performance"
 fn.52.d: "The redesigned light cruiser was named the Bayard class, and unlike the British cruisers, the French cruisers had excellent mobility, and the mobility of the entire French fleet was much stronger than that of the British fleet. The new main gun is the 152mm/55 Mle 1935 (SP) gun, which uses a more complex sliding lifting mechanism, which greatly increases the firing speed based on the originally planned Grasse 152mm gun, with a theoretical firing rate of 10 rounds per minute, but also significantly increases the weight of the turret, with a single turret weighing 175t. The secondary gun is equipped with four dual-equipped 100mm/55 Model 1940  dual-purpose guns, and the anti-aircraft weapons are 8 dual-equipped 37mm/70 Model 1935 anti-aircraft guns, 20 single Erie air defense guns, and 2 triple 533mm torpedoes. The use of 2 sets of high-temperature steam turbines and 6 supercharged boilers, coupled with integrated smoke exhaust pipes, can output an astonishing 120000 hp, providing a limit speed of 34.5 knots for the whole ship."

The detailed indicators are as follows: length: 189.6m. Standard displacement: 12000 tons. Fully loaded displacement: 15000 tons.

The strong ability to break through and harass makes it a problem that the French have to face. The C4 cruiser is out of date, and the achievement of the C5 program has become the fresh blood that the French navy urgently needs. It brings the last pride of the French, but the draft of the C5 design was defeated one by one. When many enterprises were unable to complete this task, C5SA1 appeared. The only difference is the air defense firepower. We are proud to use a 13.2mm machine gun 37mm medium-range air defense weapon after all.

 fn.42.d: "In the early 1930s, in response to the Italian Zara-class heavy cruisers, we built the Algeria class heavy cruiser with equally excellent protection. Although its treaty-based design scheme has been unable to meet the current requirements, its design ideas can still be used as a good reference. In the end, the protection design of the new ship followed the Algeria-class system, which was comprehensively strengthened on the basis of it, and became a new protection standard for heavy cruisers after the French navy got rid of the restrictions of the treaty. The specific design is as follows: the waterline armor is 150mm, the surface hardened armor is used to peel off the armor-piercing projectile cap, the tilt is 10 degrees, and the lower end is gradually reduced to 80mm; the horizontal protection is a single layer of 70mm horizontal uniform armor deck, and the top of the ammunition depot is strengthened to 90mm. The protection of the main turret is 203mm for the front, 100mm to 120mm for the side, 102mm for the top, 90mm for the rear, and 160mm for the seat. The front and top of the command tower armor are 160mm and 102mm respectively, with a total armor weight of 2700 tons. Underwater protection adopts double bottom protection, with a multi torpedo protection compartment and watertight compartment, which has also become the new standard underwater protection scheme of French navy cruisers."

 fn.43.d: "The first threat to the new ship is the new German heavy cruiser equipped with 203mm/60 SK C/34 artillery. To gain the upper hand in the artillery battle, firepower advantage is essential in addition to excellent protection. The ship's main firepower is three triplets, with a total of nine new 203mm/55 Mle 1934 guns. The gun is 11.5 meters long and weighs 17.4 tons. The armor-piercing projectile used weighs 140 kilograms. The initial velocity can reach 844 meters per second when fired with a heavy charge, and the maximum range is 32 kilometers at a 40-degree elevation. In the actual test, the gun can penetrate 270mm vertical surface hardened armor at 10000 (20000) meters and 70mm horizontal homogeneous armor at 20000 meters. The maximum firing speed is 5 rounds/min, and it can reach 4 rounds/min in actual combat. Since the naval exercise in 1937, the French navy has attached great importance to the ability of ship air defense. The secondary gun and outer air defense firepower of the new ship adopts seven duplex 100mm/45 Mle 1933  dual-purpose guns, which have been widely used in a large number of new battleships, aircraft carriers and cruisers with good performance and high reliability. After careful study, comparison, and testing, the French navy finally chose its 37mm/70 anti-aircraft guns and imported Swiss 20mm Erlihole guns as medium-and short-range air defense weapons, equipped with a total of 6 dual 37mm/70 anti-aircraft guns and 8 twin and 12 single-mounted 20mm Oerlikon guns, so the ship's air defense capability is very excellent.

Now, we finally have a chance to realize one of the early plans for the 'Richelieu' class, which was to use a triple 406mm main gun. Rumor has it that Imperial Japan is secretly building a super battleship with firepower and armor far beyond current standards. The new 406mm/50 Model 1938 guns have greater armor erosion and greater power, actually tested at 20,000 (30,000) meters, eroding 515 (386) mm of horizontal armor and 95 (159) mm of vertical armor, more than enough to deal with potential threats. Due to weight constraints, the new ship was planned to be fitted with two new 406mm main guns, with the secondary guns continuing to use three triple 152mm/55 Model 1935 guns, with the same layout of the main and secondary guns as the 'Gascony'. In order to cope with the threat of a large number of Japanese naval aviation, the new ship focuses on strengthening the anti-aircraft firepower, and is expected to install eight twin 100mm/45 Model 1933 anti-aircraft guns (arranged on both sides of the hull), twelve twin 37mm/70 Model 1935 anti-aircraft guns (arranged on both sides of the forward secondary guns, both sides of the port side, and on both sides of the aft secondary guns), and twenty twin 20mm Erlikon anti-aircraft guns (arranged all over the hull), as well as installing the latest search and fire control radar, the air defense capability is the strongest among the 'Richelieu' class. According to the strategic plan, the ship will be the core force against the enemy surface fleet and serve as the flagship of the entire French Indochina fleet, and the Duke of Richelieu has suggested that it be named 'Champagne'."

 ##Infantry Equip

 FRA_infantry_equipment_0: "Fusil Lebel Modèle 1886 M93"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Lebel Mle M93"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Lebel is an 8mm bolt action rifle that has entered French military service since 1887. The world's first firearm to utilise smokeless powder, the rifle is known for its durability and long range. The primary weapon of the French soldier in the trenches of the Weltkrieg; large quantities of the rifle still exist even now under the new regime of the Commune."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1: "MAS Modèle 1936"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "MAS-36"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The proximity of France to the destested German Empire has hastened the call for a more modern bolt action rifle. The new MAS 36 rifle has been chosen by the Commune as the new bolt-action rifle for the revolution. A short 'carbine' style rifle that features dirt resistance and is relatively cheap to produce; the MAS 36 shall serve as the new standard arm to defend France from all her enemies."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2: "MAS Modèle 1938"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "MAS-38"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Following the end of the Weltkrieg, a small arms development programme took place in the Service Technique de l'Armement. With the help of MAS (the weapon's industry, the MAS 38 would be France's first submachine gun. An extremely high quality weapon, the MAS 38 features a fire rate of 650 rounds per minute although its appearance is rather odd given its unorthodox layout."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_3: "MAS Modèle 1940/42"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "MAS-40/42"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The MAS-40/42 is the latest in a series of Communard semi-automatic rifles. Unlike its predecessors, however, the MAS-40/42 was found to be exceptionally reliable in French military testing. The original five round internal magazine, however, was deemed insufficient and a new variant of the MAS-40/42, the 40/42, was developed featuring a detachable ten round box magazine."
 FRA_support_weapons: "FM Chauchat & Brandt Mle 27/31"
 FRA_support_weapons_desc: "Tried and tested in the trenches of the Weltkrieg, the Chauchat has long been hated by the French infantryman. However, despite the hatred for this weapon, when it is not jammed with dirt and mud, the gun is quite reliable to control, and the Chauchat can be fired from the hip as well. The Brandt mortar is a relic from the Weltkrieg, a refinement of the British 'Stokes' trench mortar. A simple and effective weapon, the mortar can be dissembled into three parts and requires a crew of ten."
 FRA_support_weapons2: "Hotchkiss M1922 & Brandt Mle 27/31"
 FRA_support_weapons2_desc: "A sturdy and reliable weapon, the Hotchkiss M1922 is a light machine gun developed by Hotchkiss. Capable of firing 450 rounds per minute, the gun has a regulator that can adjust the rate of fire. The Hotchkiss can be fed from an overhead magazine or 15/24/30 round feed strips."
 FRA_support_weapons3: "Chatelleraut FM Mle 24/29 & Brandt Mle 35/38"
 FRA_support_weapons3_desc: "It is clear to the command of the Commune that the Chauchat and Hotchkiss are seriously outdated. Our designers have come up with a much lighter gun in preparation for the coming war than the Hotchkiss. While the Chatelleraut features a low fire rate, it is a robust and reliable weapon; well-liked by our troops for its consistency and weight. The Brandt Mle 35 is a 60mm mortar to be used by infantry companies for indirect fire. Simple and effective, it only requires a crew of five to operate."
 FRA_support_weapons4: "MAS AA-42 & Brandt Mle 1942"
 FRA_support_weapons4_desc: "Experience in the Second Weltkrieg has led to an interest in general purpose machine guns to serve a variety of tactical roles. With nearly double the rate of fire of the Chatelleraut, the AA-42 is a belt-fed monster that will mow down anything in its path. The Mle 42 is a considerable improvement over its predecessor, with an emphasis on a greater close quarters support weapon."
 FRA_infantry_at: "Canon de 75mm mle 1897 modifee 1933"
 FRA_infantry_at_desc: "The beloved French 75mm is a field gun developed for anti personal usage. While maintaing the shield and wheels of the original field gun, this variant has increased elevation and a 58 degree traverse."
 FRA_infantry_at2: "LRAC de 73mm Mle 1943"
 FRA_infantry_at2_desc: "An anti-tank rocket launcher, the LRAC can fire a 73mm high explosive antitank projectile capable of penetrating over 11 inches of rolled homogenous armour. The fear of every German tank crew, the LRAC has a shield to protect the operator from the rocket's back blast."
 FRA_infantry_weapons2: "RSC 1938 Carbine"
 FRA_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The RSC (Fusil Automatique Modele) is a semi-automatic rifle. While earlier varients were long and limited mobility, the carbine version allows for greater movement on the battlefield. This 1938 version features numerous changes to its predecessors such as simpler production, takedown, and cleaning of the rifle."
 FRA_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "MAS-36 LG39"
 FRA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "This variant of the MAS-36 comes equipped with a folding hollow aluminium stock and strengthened barrel. It can also be used for grenade launching purposes as it comes with a 48mm grenade launcher."
 FRA_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "CEAM Modele 1944"
 FRA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "A secret design copied from the German line of assualt rifles, the CEAM Modele 1944 is France's first assualt rifle. Chambered in 0.30 carbine rounds, the rifle even comes with a bipod and a folding buttstock."
