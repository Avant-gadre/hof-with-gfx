 CHL_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "In response to an aggressive Argentinian armament programme, Chile adopted a modified Mauser 1893 (commonly known as the Spanish Mauser) chambered in 7x57mm Mauser, and contracted the German company DWM (Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken) for more than 100,000 rifles and carbines on the pattern. The Chilean Mauser 1895 has earned a reputation for reliability under even the harshest conditions, one which it maintains decades after its adoption."

 CHL_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Modelo 1912/35"
 CHL_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Shortly before the Weltkrieg, Chile contracted the Austrian arms manufacturer Steyr for a new Carbine variant of the German Mauser 1898 chambered in 7x57mm like older Chilean rifles. Many of these carbines eventually fell into the hands of the Chilean Carabinieros, who found the rifle unsatisfactory and lobbied for its replacement. In 1935, a new pattern with improved ergonomics and a new larger magazine with more robust feed lips and loader was approved and entered into production shortly thereafter."
