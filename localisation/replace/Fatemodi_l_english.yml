 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, VVP has consolidated its power and its attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Nero's Roamn Empire continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."

 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "British politics lies in a careful balance between the king-centric Knights of the Round Table and the parliamentary clock tower. Although the prestige of King Arthur I cannot be underestimated, the clock tower still has a strong political and economic influence in Britain. A Welsh-born king restricted England's dominance over the country and thus eased domestic separatist tendencies. The powerful HMS defended the British Isles and overseas colonies. \nHowever, this smooth climate of governance meets the challenge of extremism in continental Europe. And British colonies overseas are also facing nationalism challenges worldwide. The King's character is known for his rectitude. How long can the stability of British politics remain in this situation?"
 
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The French Royal Family, which regained power, was in a state of flux. The suspension of the throne led to the absence of a head of state, the fragmentation of domestic political forces and the disorder of the people. The Dragon Witch is engaged in destructive activities in Orleans; Germany and Italy are in irritablity. France, in the midst of internal and external troubles, urgently needs a leader to lead them to the future of the French people and to face their own destiny."
 
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The effort of Roman revivalists had paid off: the ancient empire has now risen again. But the reform on the politics could not solve the problem of weakness of the previous Italy in economy and military. The Emperor Nero was regarded as a tyrant and the enemy of Christians. On the other time, the tension between the Empeeror and Senatus is constantly increasing, which make the country even more unstable. \n\n However the Emperor has met her new friends: Fascists. The chance of a thorough renewal is quite appealling. How will this ancient and new empire choice her path?"
 
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the first Asian country that make its modernization, Japan stands at the crossroad of Asia and Europe. The wheel of expansion and invasion has begun to roll, but the domestic situation is not so promising: extremists are always threating the democratic but corrupt government, and new factions of political power inside the bureaucrats are also rising. At the same time, the government is in fierce confict with the military. \n Japanese diplomacy is swinging between imperialism, which requires Japan to expand its territory and realm, and pan-asianism, which imagines Japan as the liberator of the Asia from western colonists. The choice of Japanese is related to the fate of the whole Asia."
 
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the biggest victim of the Treaty of Versailles, the German state has not set off the retro movement of royal politics in other European powers. It has always adhered to the restrictions and peace imposed by the Treaty of Versailles ... before everything can be used. \n\n The Hohenzollern family, a symbol of the old order, has long been firmly controlled by the radical Dutch nationalists. The Valkist Germany can no longer be shaken. "Germany will prevail!". And the hero just looked at them and said nothing. Maybe he also had his own plans?"
 
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The October Revolution delivered Lenin's version of socialism to Russia with a bang, and within a few years the red flag was planted over half of the once immense but impoverished empire. Observers did not anticipate that this revolution would expand so quickly, just as they did not anticipate that it would be stubbornly stopped west of Siberia by the White Army. \n\nThe lack of industrialization gradually sapped the nascent revolutionary regime of its own energy, a regime that had to face both internal and external enemies, and the almost unattainable task of industrialization. It had to make a choice, even if the cost was quite heavy..."
 
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1919, when Hungary withstood joint armed intervention from its arch-rival Romania and two nascent states, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, prompted the Allies to abandon all claims for reparations against the country and hastily demarcate the post-war borders roughly along the cease-fire lines of the time. \n\n Being the only member of the Central Powers that did not sign the Versailles Peace Treaty, Hungary possessed a far stronger nationalism than the average traditional state, and Bathory, the national hero who led the 1919 war to victory, took this opportunity to remain in the position of regent. Of course, the war never really ended, and the next time the Dacians crossed the Carpathian was just around the corner."

 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania entered the World War as if on speculation and was swiftly defeated by the Central Powers, only to recover its territory and continue its territorial claims from the war after the collapse of the Central Powers in 1918, pulling together the fledgling nations of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia to attack a lone Hungary should not have been as difficult as it was in 1916. \n\nAnother failure completely brought the foreign royal family to the bottom of its reputation, and the angry Dacians elected their own king after driving them out of the country. In view of the repeated betrayals by the Mazars this king vowed to complete his revenge, and the emergence of the ultra-nationalist group of the Angelic Presidency Mikhail's Legion soon gained his favor with its position of protecting the king, and the next battle of Karpatan, which gathered the strength of the whole nation, is about to be prepared."

 news.114.d:0 "Today the last resistance movement in Paris has been extinguished and the city is now firmly controlled by the Italian army. \n\n [ITA.GetLeader] hurriedly flew to the victory parade on the Champs-Elysées. He rode a white horse to the front of the parade. At the celebration, [ITA.GetLeader] compared the current victory with Caesar's conquest of Gaul, and promised that this was only the beginning of the great rise of Rome. \n\n Time will tell if what he said is correct."
 news.22.d:0 "Italian diplomats submitted an ultimatum to the Albanian government asking them to accept Italy's complete military occupation. \n\n King Zorg announced his abdication after realizing that resistance was useless, and Albania became the first part of the Confederacy led by the Roman ruler [ITA.GetLeader]. \n\n [ITA.GetNameDef] eyes on the Balkans ..."
