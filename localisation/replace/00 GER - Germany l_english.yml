They will definitely agree to continue our assistance ... and grant garrison rights ... Much easier."
 germany.584.a: "Then we should express our good intentions."

 germany.585.d: "What if you have no soldiers? [GER.GetName] proposes to alleviate this problem for them. They provide a piece of arms assistance. They still do n't need money. We only need to allow the Germans to cross the border legally ... In other words, there is almost nothing neutral about what is accepted, and They ca n't just be stationed, so ..."

They even opened fire on leading protesters, killing 21 people on the spot. As the backing of all Germans, we may not be able to send troops to kill the Frenchman directly, but it is totally feasible to do a little action ... directly support the Rhineland local national movement to carry out a big explosion in Paris! It is important to note that this could lead to a tougher response from France."

A Renault car full of explosives crashed and crushed several pedestrians and ran into the police convoy which is in interception and detonated... the accident caused a total of 27 casualties, and 12 people died on the spot. The identity of the perpetrators was very clear, and the German language shouting hate phrases such as "blood debt and blood compensation" was not deactivated.

Now he has two documents in front of him, one drafted by the Strasser brothers, listing a detailed "National Valkism" program and a profusion of state-owned economic development plans. Grigor Strasser, who is no longer in the world, wrote in the preface, "Dear Your Excellency, this document will lead to a real and great nation of people." On the right is the joint letter by the veterans headed by Anton Drexler. Here, "National Valkism" is still an abstract concept, just like the mission-oriented command of our military has never been too restrictive.

However, the National Socialist faction believes that this number can continue to expand. It can try to integrate the Siegfried Jugend and Siegfried Mädel Bund and teach relevant skills to young women of the right age. The traditional party expressed fierce opposition to this proposal, thinking that it only needs to further strengthen the paramilitary training function of the Youth League as a pure auxiliary support force.

However, for the National Socialist faction, the ancient Germanic culture is only a symbol. At the moment, it is enough to remove the atheistic state of the influence of the Christian church, but all members including the Strasser brothers dare not talk about this topic.

Naturally, the current guard commander Heinrich Himmler will be happy about this and will actively stand on the side of the deceased old governor.

He strongly demanded This kind of colleges and universities launches a "special rectification", not only to find the murderer, but also to use this as an opportunity to wipe out all the "potential saboteurs". This idea has now been recognized by the vast majority of people present. Our universities have long served as a fortress of liberalism to shelter a large number of dissidents.

After drinking a cup of coffee from the Security Bureau, these people would not dare to act rashly even if they still wanted to. \n\nIt's just that the consequences of such a big fight soon appeared.

Through the forcible annexation of the French industry, the strength of the Hermann Goering National Factory finally achieved a full crush on the old industrial giants such as Krupp. Now, as long as Goering moves his fingers, the steel earl, who used to be so arrogant in the past, will have to shake three times. Of course, he does not intend to be so arrogant and take such a big advantage. Naturally, he has to be humble: "Integrating industry is also to better serve Germany. Isn't it?" "

Although the two have a good personal relationship, the RSHA and the Abwehr have also stipulated the "Ten Commandments": one is inside and the other is outside.

However, another person had previously deployed bodyguards and shot Wessel accurately after the love enemy missed a shot. Both of these murderers cleverly completed their own assassinations in the conspiracy of others.

No wonder there was no information about this person in any search within the European continent. However, why did the director of the dignified military intelligence agency do this? thing? I vaguely remember that when he brought down the Social Democratic Party government back then, he was still a part of it. "Director, this news is really interesting, although we still have another equally interesting news." The man in fancy clothes still made a slick tone at the silent Heydrich. "What else?"

Hey, because of the good personal relationship between the two families on weekdays, Heydrich decided not to tell Canaris the truth, so that he would die in prison so confidently. \n\nThe real culprit currently presumed to be a lone traveler is still hidden in the dark, and according to the secret communication intercepted by the Dutch, this person seems to be more "impulsive". The last letter to Canaris claimed that " If I can't, I will kill the Commissioner", and the letter that Canaris didn't send only said "Don't be impulsive." \n\nAs the "Commissioner" Heydrich didn't dare to neglect, he had made all the preparations before going to the Palace of the Führer to report on the Canaris case, but today he went all out.

In the meeting, Heydrich listed the many problems in the implementation of Siegfriedism from the perspective of a realist. For example, we are almost fundamental in the battle. Unable to maintain a "friendly" image, the brutal repressive methods of the German army in the occupied areas are not much better than any army in history. \n\nBut this is not a problem with the German army, this is war!

 more_ger.108.t: ""Mediterranean Pseudo-History Examination""
 more_ger.108.d: ""The so-called civilizations such as ancient Greece and Rome are just myths concocted by intellectuals during the Renaissance!" \n\nMr. Alfred Rosenberg, a famous cultural scholar who is also our cultural commissioner, has recently published his new work--"Mediterranean Pseudo-History Examination", according to the book's rigorous narrative and arguments, the so-called ancient Greeks and Romans were nothing but looters and According to the book's rigorous narrative and argument, the so-called ancient Greeks and Romans were merely looters who plundered and stole the culture of immigrants from the far north. The main argument of Mr. Alfred Rosenberg is that the civilization of ancient Greece and Rome actually came from the Germanic people. Since the kind of conflict between the Germanic civilization in the Far North and the barbarians in the Mediterranean, that is, the Battle of Teutonburg Forest, the civilization from the Germanic region gradually shifted southward. Rosenberg pointed out not only that the civilization of Greece and Rome came from the Germanic people, but also that the process of transferring civilization to the south was accompanied by the degeneration of civilization. That is, the perfect spirit of Germanic nobleness, valor and fortitude gradually degenerated into the selfishness, weakness and calculation characteristic of the Mediterranean people. The rise of Florentine commerce and the Renaissance in the Middle Ages made the Mediterranean intellectuals dissatisfied with their historical destiny of being a marginal civilization, and then fabricated a large number of false histories of ancient Rome and ancient Greece. \n\nRosenberg also quoted extensively from German philosophers, from Fichte and Hegel to Nietzsche. According to Rosenberg, all these philosophers had actually recognized the falsity of Greek civilization, but were forced by the pressure of European cultural circles not to speak out. Rosenberg looks extensively at Nietzsche's works The Birth of Tragedy and Thus Spoke Zarathustra for evidence, claiming that the "spirit of Dionysus" advocated by Nietzsche is actually the "spirit of Siegfried" and that Nietzsche's discussion of Wagner's opera is actually Nietzsche's discussion of Wagner's opera is a kind of flashback to criticize the Greeks' shameless act of falsifying civilization. This claim is strongly supported by Professor Heidegger, a leading expert on Nietzsche. Rosenberg incidentally criticized Karl Marx, arguing that Marxism was a conspiracy by Mediterranean civilization to try to reverse the re-emergence of Germanic civilization. \n\naturally the book was met with widespread protests and abuse from forces outside ---- especially [ITA.GetName] and [GRE.GetName] as soon as it was published. However, the truth will not be refuted by a few mockery words. In the popular German radio program "This is Germany", Dr. Goebbels personally connected with the audience to discuss the "Pseudo-History of the Mediterranean", and almost every patriotic viewer who participated in the interaction fiercely criticized the shameless remarks of the "Romans". Dr. Goebbels also connected with Mr. Ribbentrop and asked him to tell his impressions of Nero when he met him in Rome. Dr. Goebbels quotes and proves that Nero's full body attire was actually an imitation of Arminius, the Germanic leader who defeated the Romans at the Battle of Teutonic Forest, proving once again that Roman civilization was in fact an imitator and successor of Germanic civilization. \n\nAlthough the book focuses on the fact that the Mediterranean countries forged their civilization, it also consistently mentions and praises the great ancestors of the People of the Far North--the Germanic peoples. It cannot be denied that the book still has a great political value, like other works of Mr. Rosenberg, and that some high government officials, out of the need to promote our great culture and ideology, consider that it should be treated as an official publication and that a war must be declared against the cultural theft of the Latin world!"

Not only did they falsify the culture of the Mediterranean region in the book, but they also carried out personal attacks on the leaders of the countries in the Mediterranean region in their radio programs. From their point of view, the full-length clothing of the Roman emperor Nero was imitated by Arminius, the German leader who defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest; all the military writings of the Greek General Achilles were copied from Clauser Witz and Guderian; even the religious literature and paintings of the Holy See are, in their opinion, copied from the "temporarily lost" works of the Teutonic Knights.

The workers turned on the boiler to release steam and screamed the Frenchman who was trying to occupy the factory. At this time, the ambushed Freikorps fighters immediately launched a counterattack. Although they failed to successfully repel the French army, the heroic actions of the workers and the Freikorps won a lot of support in the country and laid the foundation for the victory of the revolution in 1920. It also won the praise of Karl Radek and others from the Russian Bolsheviks. Many of the workers who did not sacrifice in the struggle joined the Reichsarbeitsdienst led by Strasser and became one of the important foundations of the VVP in the working class after the 1920 revolution. \n\nNow that our decisive battle with the Frenchman has arrived, the workers of the Reichsarbeitsdienst are no longer satisfied with fighting the German enemies only on the production line.

As the war resumed, Oskar Dirlewanger and Theodor Eicke were released again under Berger's efforts, and their VVP membership was restored.

 #Infantry Equip

 GER_infantry_equipment_0: "Gewehr Modell 98"
 GER_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser G. 98"
 GER_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Gewehr 98 (Rifle 98) was the standard German infantry weapon of the Weltkrieg. It is a good example of the type of military rifle designed around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when rifle development reached fever pitch. In common with other armies, the German infantry carried a full length rifle, while other troops were issued with shorter carbines. The bolt and magazine system of the Gewehr 98 was designed by the Mauser company, although the rifle was produced under licence by a number of other commercial manufacturers. It was a well-made and accurate weapon, but was not well suited to trench warfare."
 #Mauser Standardmodell :
 GER_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabiner Modell 98 Ausführung B"
 GER_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser Kar. 98b"
 GER_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs."
 GER_infantry_equipment_2: "Selbstladegewehr Modell 40"
 GER_infantry_equipment_2_short: "S.G. 40"
 GER_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by the Mauser company in response to a desire of the German Army for a self-loading rifle with a backup bolt action, the Selbstladegewehr 40 is a massive leap forward in German small arms design. While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the Heer eventually dropped some of its other specific requirements for the rifle. The end result was the initial prototype with only a few design edits, and it proved effective."
 GER_infantry_equipment_3: "Maschinenkarabiner Modell 42"
 GER_infantry_equipment_3_short: "M.Kb. 42"
 GER_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Maschinenkarabiner 42 is a revolutionary design chambered for a new intermediate cartridge, developed by famous German arms designer Hugo Schmeisser, in conjunction with the Haenel company. While the first prototype of the rifle was prone to jamming, both the military and even the Kaiser himself were extremely enthusiastic about the project, and immense resources were concentrated on improving the design, with the rifle deemed ready for adoption in 1942."
 #G33/40:
 GER_infantry_weapons2: "Gewehr Modell 98/38"
 GER_infantry_weapons2_short: "G. 98/38"
 GER_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Gewehr 98/38, also simply known as the G. 98/38, is a bolt-action rifle, sometimes considered a carbine, and based heavily on the Gewehr 98. The rifle is rather short, at only one metre long. Originally designed for the Mountain troops, the G. 98/38 was soon adopted by other German forces, including some cavalry and infantry regiments."
 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 40"
 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "M.P. 40"
 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The M.P. 40, sometimes incorrectly called 'Schmeisser', was developed by Heinrich Vollmer and based on M.P. 38, with the aim of equipping German soldiers with an assault weapon. It uses magazines of 32 cartridges of 9mm, with its effective range being about 100-150 metres. It is a very reliable and particularly economical weapon to manufacture, usually used by officers, mechanised infantry and paratroopers."
 #StG 44:
 GER_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Maschinenkarabiner Modell 44"
 GER_advanced_infantry_weapons2_short: "M.Kb. 44 'Sturmgewehr'"
 GER_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Maschinenkarabiner 44 is the outcome of the German need to provide infantrymen with heavier firepower from their rifles. As a result of the continuous development of M.Kb. 42, the M.Kb. 44 is devoid of many of the disadvantages of the previous design and is even sometimes called the 'Sturmgewehr' - the assault rifle. The final design has a shorter range than contemporary rifles due to German research that most of the combat in the European War takes place at distances less than 300 metres. At the sacrifice of range, close range firepower was greatly improved."
 #Panzerfaust - whole line, don't add numbers:
 GER_infantry_at: "Panzerabwehrrohr"
 GER_infantry_at_short: "Pa.R."
 GER_infantry_at_desc: "The Panzerabwehrrohr is the brainchild of Dr. Heinrich Langweiler, in response to an urgent requirement for a light one-shot throw-away infantry weapon with which infantry could use to tackle the growing numbers of enemy heavy and medium tanks, that are frequently overwhelming German defences. The range of the first Panzerabwehrrohr was only 30 metres, which made their use somewhat hazardous, until more developed variants with increased range came to production."
 #Panzerschreck:
 GER_infantry_at2: "Raketenpanzerbüchse 54"
 GER_infantry_at2_short: "R.Pz.B. 54 'Panzerschreck'"
 GER_infantry_at2_desc: "The Raketenpanzerbüchse 54 shoulder-launched anti-tank rocket launchers, nicknamed 'Ofenrohr' ('stove pipe') and the more popular 'Panzerschreck' ('Tank's Fright'), are lightweight infantry weapons developed for the German military, inspired by the rumours about American rocket launchers. Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks' armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers. As a drawback, the R.Pz.B. 54 produces a lot of smoke upon firing."
 GER_support_weapons: "Maschinengewehr M.08/15 & 7,58-cm leichter Minenwerfer"
 GER_support_weapons_short: "M.G. 08/15 & 7,58-cm l.M.W."
 GER_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Now, as we find ourselves watched by enemies such as the Commune of France, these weapons from the Weltkrieg will be brought back into service."
 GER_support_weapons2: "Maschinengewehr M.34 & 8-cm schwerer Granatwerfer M.34"
 GER_support_weapons2_short: "M.G. 34 & 8-cm s.G.W. 34"
 GER_support_weapons2_desc: "The Maschinengewehr Modell 34 (M.G. 34) is a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility make it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world; a testament to the power of the Kaiserreich.

 GER_motorized_equipment_1_desc: "The German Army in the early 1930s had more than 100 different vehicle designs in service, leading to massive logistical difficulties. In order to standardise their vehicle fleet, they opted for a commercial truck design by Adam Opel AG of Brandenburg to become their standard cargo truck. With only slight modifications to meet military requirements, presented in 1930, the Opel Blitz was accepted in service with designation Kraftfahrzeug 305 and by 1936 became the main truck of the German Army. Although well built, the Kfz.305 suffers from being rather too complicated for reliability in the rugged conditions, but still has better performance than other German trucks."

Ordered in 1935 for use by German Army engineers, the Landwasserschlepper (Land Water Tractor) was intended as a lightweight river tug with some capacity to operate on land. Designed by Borsig of Düsseldorf, the hull of the L.W.S. is similar to that of a motor launch, resembling a tracked boat with twin rear-mounted tunnelled propellers and twin rudders. On land, it moves on steel-shod tracks with four bogies per side."

Initially developed in 1932 as 6 wheels variants, it was obvious that this variant will be obsolete in the nearest future. In 1937 the 8 wheels variant armed with 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon was introduced in service. The all-wheel drive four-axle Sd.Kfz. 231 are one of the most technically advanced armoured vehicles and are able to operate on rough terrain, with a cross-country comparable to that of tanks."

This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 GER_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 GER_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 GER_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

 GER_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 GER_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 GER_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 GER_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 GER_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

Designed for interdiction of materiel and logistics, the plane had to be thickly armoured for its low-level head-on strafing runs. While initially Henschel used a low power Argus engine it was later switched to a higher power BMW engine, eventually leading to serial production of the aircraft.

 GER_fighter_equipment_0_short: "Ff 68"
 GER_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "Designed to replace the Ff 65, the Ff 68 met the most optimistic expectations in terms of handling and agility from the outset. Victory in a training battle against its main competitor Hb 51 finally confirmed the Ff 68 as the next German fighter. While now are mainly outdated planes (despite objections from the Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen side), they are still used as the night fighters by the German military."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_0: "Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen Träger-Jagdflugzeug 68"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_0_short: "Ff 68 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "A well liked biplane, the Ff 68 was selected into service aboard the Kaiserliche Marine's aircraft carriers. Little modification was needed to make them suitable for carrier service, and much like their ground-based counterparts, it received high praise by carrier crews for its docile control characteristics."
 GER_fighter_equipment_1: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Jagdflugzeug 109"
 GER_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf 109"
 GER_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke responded to a fighter tender with the modern mono-plane Bf 109 design. Despite the generally accepted point of view in German military circles that a fighter must necessarily be a biplane, the Bf 109 fighter, mounting the DB 600 engine, was accepted in service due to its heavier armament and significantly higher top speed compared with other designs, not to mention the ability of recovering from the spin almost at any time."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_1: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Träger-Jagdflugzeug 109"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf 109 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "With the significantly improved knowledge of aerodynamics and engine performance, the Kaiserliche Marine sent out contracts for a new carrier-borne aircraft. Unsurprisingly, they selected the Bf 109 that won the contract issued by the Heer. Modifications were made to ensure that it was carrier capable, including the wings and control surfaces being lengthened, fitting tailhooks and catapult fittings, as well as the implementation of foldable wingtips."
 GER_fighter_equipment_2: "Focke-Wulf Jagdflugzeug 190"
 GER_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Fw 190"
 GER_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Difficulties to produce enough Daimler-Benz inline engines and successes of using radial engines in fighter designs by other nations, made the prospects of building a radial engine powered fighter promising. Developed by the personal initiative of Kurt Waldemar Tank, the chief engineer of Focke-Wulf, the Fw 190 design is notable for the survivability of the structure, ease of management, widespread use of modular assembly methods and ease of maintenance. Outperforming the still good Bf 109, but having child diseases of engine and concerning pilots with its armament, the new fighter was accepted in service after initial tests."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_2: "Focke-Wulf Träger-Jagdflugzeug 190"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Fw 190 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Due to limits of the Bf 109 airframe such as a weak and problematic gear leg, made a new fighter platform necessary and difficulties in developing the Bf 155 project means that producing a purpose-built carrier-borne fighter is out of the question. A conversion of the latest fighter aircraft, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 was selected. Modifications were made, much like the Bf 109 T, fitting tailhooks and catapult fittings."
 #Ta 152:
 GER_fighter_equipment_3: "Focke-Wulf Jagdflugzeug 152"
 GER_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Fw 152"
 GER_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "By early 1944, it became apparent that the development potential of the Fw 190 with the BMW 801 engine had dwindled. This became even more apparent with the advent of the new enemy fighters. A heavily modified Fw 190, the Fw 152 design development started in 1942 and has such features as increased fuel tanks alongside with speed and much heavier armament compared with the Fw 190. It's outstanding performance and ensuing popularity with the crews made it the poster child of Germany's air forces."
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_3: "Focke-Wulf Träger-Jagdflugzeug 152"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Fw 152 T"
 GER_cv_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "With far too many technical issues plaguing the Bf 155, as well as diminishing performance improvement compared to the fighters in service and over-commitment by Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the project for a dedicated carrier fighter is cancelled. For a new generation of carrier fighter, it necessitated selecting and modifying a new land-based fighter. The Fw 152 combined the best of both the Bf 109 and the Fw 190, and is well suited for modification and service."
 GER_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Jagdflugzeug 262"
 GER_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf 262"
 GER_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Designed and created to replace older propeller-based aircraft the Bf 262 becomes the new poster child of our air force. One of the first of its type worldwide it is powered by two turbojet engines with which it can reach a higher speed than other conventional planes. The Air High Command has high hopes in the project, with the aim of eventually modernising the entire air fleet."
 #Heinkel P.1079B:
 GER_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Hansa-Brandenburg Jagdflugzeug 179"
 GER_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Hb 179"
 GER_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Direct successor to the Bf 262, the design of the Hb 179 includes a V-shaped body with sweepback wings. It is a single seat aircraft, powered by two Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet engines making it faster than the Bf 262 and featuring an improved throttle, greatly decreasing the chance of a compressor stall, which plagued its predecessor."

 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Fieseler See-Mehrzweckflugzeug 167"
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Fi 167"
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Developed and built mainly for the use on carrier ships, the Fi 167 was also adopted by the Seeflieger of the Imperial Navy. Despite it's archaic looking design the biplane possesses great capabilities in agility due to its Benz & Cie engine. With its top speed of 325 km/h it forms the fast and heavy hitting core of the Küstenfliegergruppen."
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Fieseler Träger-Mehrzweck-Flugzeug 167"
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Fi 167 T"
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The main difference between the Fi 167 and the Fi 167 T is in armament. While their Küstenflieger counterpart usually carries bombs, most carrier-based Fieseler planes are equipped with LT F5b torpedoes."
 #Fokker T.VIII:
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Fokker Wasserflugzeug 80"
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Fk 80"
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "After Anthony Fokker left with most of his firm for the Netherlands, the Imperial Army had to look for more politically reliable companies. This changed during the von Tirpitz chancellorship when Fokker reopened their plant in Germany and participated in design contests, eventually scoring a victory with the T.VIII. Called Fokker 80 by the German air force it is powered by a BMW 132 K and can carry bombs or torpedoes as heavy as 750 kilograms, making it a very formidable naval aviation aircraft."
 #Fokker T.VIII:
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Fokker Träger-Mehrzweckflugzeug 80"
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Fk 80 T"
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Replacing the outdated Fi 167 T, Fokker had to make amends design wise. While the Fk 80 was developed to be used purely as a seaplane, engineers were quick to replace the floats with retractable gear."
 #P194:
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Blohm & Voss See-Mehrzweckflugzeug 194"
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "Ha 194"
 GER_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "Spiritual successor to the Ha 141, the Ha 194 kept the strangely asymmetrical design with the cockpit on the starboard side of the plane. Even though some air commanders are critical of the aircraft, it has proven to be highly agile and capable of travelling far distances without any stops."
 #P194:
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Blohm & Voss Träger-Mehrzweckflugzeug 194"
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "Ha 194 T"
 GER_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "Despite the relatively large wingspan of the airplane, the Ha 194 was also adopted by the Imperial Navy as carrier aircraft, mainly due to its high range as well as the short runway usage during landings and takeoffs."

 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Zerstörer 110"
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf 110"
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Created as a heavy fighter aircraft with more range than the Bf 109, the Air Service conducted a competition which was won by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke. Additionally to the advantage in range the armament of the Bf 110 is unusually strong - consisting of three 20mm cannons in the front. Even though less agile it proves to be an exceptional airplane, especially suited for use in our colonial holdings."
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Junkers Zerstörer 88"
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Ju 88"
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "Initially designed to be a fast bomber, the Ju 88 can fit into many roles, including air supremacy and interception missions. Chosen to succeed the Bf 110, it is more aerobatic and agile and capable of covering a larger air area than its predecessor."
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Hansa-Brandenburg Zerstörer 219"
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "Hb 219"
 GER_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Building on the strengths of the Ju 88, the designers at Hansa-Brandenburg designed the Hb 219. With superior air stability and higher agility the plane is able to better intercept and destroy enemy planes. Its newer engine and better aerodynamic construction allow for higher speeds and cover of greater ranges. The newly developed livery helps to disguise the plane better, making it harder for enemy fighters to spot it."

 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Junkers Mittlerer Bomber 86"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "Ju 86"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Ordered as bomber and airliner the Ju 86 is supposed to phase out any Tirpitz era planes within the Air Service. Due to its sturdy all metal construction and retractable main gear it has a very good handling and proves to be popular among pilots. It is widely used among other air forces around the world due to its excellent mid-air stability and good fuel consumption."
 #Heinkel He 111:
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Hansa-Brandenburg Mittlerer Bomber 111"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Hb 111"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "With the growing demand of bombers of Seeckt's Supreme High Command, Hansa-Brandenburg introduced the Hb 111 to support the Ju 86. With its Benz & Cie engine it is considerably faster and like its predecessor widely exported and used among many air forces around the world."
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Dornier Bomber 217"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Do 217"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "In order to replace the ageing Ju 86 and the Hb 111, the High Command ordered the production of a new generation of bombers. Designed as a naval bomber the Do 217 was replanned and transformed into a heavy bomber. Better armed than its successor and with the ability to perform dive bombing missions Dornier got the contract without facing competition."
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Junkers Bomber 188"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "Ju 188"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The Ju 188 was designed as a high performance bomber increasing the performance and the payload, following the outdated Ju 88. Even though the High Command is sceptical of the model, test pilots lauded it for its cockpit design. It is powered by two BMW engines and three propellers, significantly improving fuel efficiency and range."
 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen Strahlgetriebener Bomber 234"
 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Ff 234"
 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The development of jet engines had a great impact on the development of fighter and bomber aircraft. Among the first operational jet bombers in the world the Ff 234's great strength lies in its high speed. Faster than the usual propelled fighter plane it can outrun older enemy planes, making escapes of unguarded flights more likely. Despite its long takeoff runs it is highly aerobatic and favoured by pilots over propeller bombers."
 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Hansa-Brandenburg Strahlgetriebener Bomber 343"
 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Hb 343"
 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Even though the Ff 234 was a breakthrough in its field it still had a few issues. Among them were difficulties with the landing process and target bombing. However both aspects have been improved with the new generation, introduced by the Hb 343, creating an even faster, further reaching and more secure jet bomber."

 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Dornier Schwerer Bomber 19"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Do 19"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "After von Seeckts army innovation plans, the Air Service was tasked with putting a bigger focus towards strategic bombing efforts. This led to a competition in which the Do 19 came out victorious. A heavy bomber, the Do 19, suffers from a lacklustre performance and little space for bombs, eventually becoming a stopgap product for the upcoming Hb 177."
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_2: "Hansa-Brandenburg Schwerer Bomber 177"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_2_short: "Hb 177"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Designed and produced to replace the outdated Do 19, the Hb 177 features a far superior performance and armament as well as a spacious interior capable of carrying almost double the amount of bombs. It's all-metal construction proved to be sturdier and better to handle, albeit the big size of the plane still caused agility issues in test trials."
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_3: "Hansa-Brandenburg Langstreckenbomber 277"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_3_short: "Hb 277"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "Direct successor to the Hb 177, only little was changed. While the body remained the same, the biggest changes were the size of the wings and the engines. Instead of being powered by the often troublesome Benz & Cie engines, the Hb 277 featured BMW engines, increasing reliability and performance of the aircraft. The increased wingspan also makes the plane able to reach further away targets."
 GER_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1: "Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen Strahlgetriebener Bomber 555"
 GER_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Ff 555"
 GER_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Designed on the order of the Supreme High Command the Ff 555 is a long range flying wing jet bomber, built to be able to launch bombing campaigns in far away areas like the East Coast of North America and Asia East of the Urals. It's special V-form was chosen to allow for better aerodynamic flow to reach higher speeds."

 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Objektschutzjäger 163"
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1_short: "Bf 163"
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1_desc: "Designed as a defensive aircraft to protect the airspace from enemy planes, the Bf 163 is truly a unique object. Powered by a rocket engine, the plane is supposed to climb up to high altitude, to then take on enemy bomber groups, while gliding back to the airfield. While the High Command is highly sceptical of the design and its risky tactics, some believe in it to be the air defence of the future."
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2: "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Objektschutzjäger 263"
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_short: "Bf 263"
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_desc: "With the Bf 163 showing its weaknesses the High Command has allowed the construction of a new rocket based interceptor model. The Bf 263 is made out of sturdier materials, a pressurised cockpit and a simpler and much more efficient engine, allowing for a doubled combat altitude and a much higher chance of survival for the pilot."
 #Ba 349:
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3: "Fieseler Objektschutzjäger 349"
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_short: "Fi 349"
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_desc: "Designed as a successor to the Bf 163 and the Bf 263, the Fi 349 tried to improve various shortcomings of the other interceptors. The aircraft only needs one pilot with basic training in aiming and firing, as it would be guided by an autopilot. Additionally after the attack the pilot does not need to return to an airstrip to land, but rather is ejected and lands with a parachute. This revolutionary design allows any common man to fly the plane should the need arise."

 GER_scout_plane_equipment_1: "Henschel Nahaufklärer 126"
 GER_scout_plane_equipment_1_short: "Hs 126"
 GER_scout_plane_equipment_1_desc: "Tasked by the German Air Service, Henschel designed the Hs 126 as a high wing reconnaissance aircraft for short ranges. It is well received by pilots and the air command for its short takeoff and low speed capabilities, believed to be crucial for observation and intelligence gathering purposes."
 GER_scout_plane_equipment_2: "Focke-Wulf Aufklärer 189"
 GER_scout_plane_equipment_2_short: "Fw 189"
 GER_scout_plane_equipment_2_desc: "Winning a design competition against the Ff 198 and the Ha 141, Focke Wulf got the contract to replace the ageing Hs 126. The twin engine, twin boom, three seater tactical reconnaissance aircraft primarily operates on short distance flights. Its great manoeuvrability in dog fighting situations is praised by pilots."
