 IRE_economic_advancement_act: "Irish Economic Advancement Act"
 IRE_economic_advancement_act_desc: "Despite gaining our freedom, the economy of our fine island has laid stagnant for quite some time and is even, in some places, decaying. With the passing of the Irish Economic Advancement Act (IEAA) the Dáil can address this vital issue. Ireland may be small, but her people are industrious, and her cities have plenty of room to grow."
 IRE_agricultural_reform_drive: "农业改革行动"
 IRE_agricultural_reform_drive_desc: "The rural areas of Ireland are by far the most neglected by the government to date, and could easily serve as a starting point for radical economic improvement. Our farming methods are woefully out of date compared to the agricultural revolutions taking place in mainland Europe, and our infrastructure is woefully behind."
 IRE_mechanised_farming_reform: "机械化农业改革"
 IRE_mechanised_farming_reform_desc: "There's no doubt that the farming industry is one of the biggest in our nation. The current agricultural techniques used however leave a lot to be desired. Through adopting the sort of advances in mechanisation seen in the United States and in Europe, we can bring our farms up to speed. Farms feed the people, and therefore they are the lifeblood of growth."
 IRE_rural_renovations_maintenance: "Rural Renovations and Maintenance Board"
 IRE_rural_renovations_maintenance_desc: "The rural areas of Ireland are in need of considerable renovations and maintenance. There is currently no public body tasked with doing these repairs, leaving rural communities to rely on notoriously unreliable private businesses. Putting this into government hands will keep our roads well maintained in good repair. A national maintenance team will also no doubt have benefits should the nation be at war."
 IRE_transeireann_national_network: "TransÉireann National Network"
 IRE_transeireann_national_network_desc: "The railway infrastructure left in place by the British is functional but lacking in comparison to the new high speed rail infrastructure being constructed in Europe. We should learn from our continental neighbours and make an effort to modernise our railways. This will also have a significant effect on our industry's productivity, allowing us to get raw materials more easily to our factories."
 IRE_industry_for_ireland: "Industry for Ireland"
 IRE_industry_for_ireland_desc: "Our civilian industry has an enormous potential for growth. There is a major unemployment problem in our nation, with many families too poor to regularly feed themselves. By revitalising our industry we can both create new jobs and improve the economic strength of our nation."
 IRE_revitalise_the_north: "Revitalise the North"
 IRE_revitalise_the_north_desc: "After joining the Republic, the northern most region of Ulster has been in an industrial slump relative to the rest of the nation. Belfast once used to be a thriving industrial city and other towns and cities such as Derry and Coleraine were looking likely to follow. Revisiting this issue and energising the north with industrial investments will help to lift the region."
 IRE_national_industrial_investment: "National Industrial Investment Fund"
 IRE_national_industrial_investment_desc: "Constructing and expanding our nations industry is vital if Ireland is going to play any sort of key role on the world stage in the future. We need to make funds available to finance our rapid industrialisation project. This will allow us more room for expansion and more efficient construction, depending on how much funds we make available."
 IRE_set_up_dias: "Set up the DIAS"
 IRE_set_up_dias_desc: "While Ireland has three well-established Universities, they are lacking in investment, largely due to our rather stagnant economy. This is particularly true for post-doctoral research in the sciences. We should look to setting up a new institution that is focused purely on research, and in emerging fields such as Theoretical Physics. With this specialist focus, we could look to attracting leading figures from abroad, as well as encourage the growth of an innovative population."
 IRE_financial_industrial_capital: "Establish A Financial and Industrial Capital"
 IRE_financial_industrial_capital_desc: "The rise of Syndicalism in Britain has created a void in the wider region that Ireland could potentially fill. Non-Syndicalist nations could look to Ireland as a lead trade nation, situated in the Atlantic between the American and European continents. With some effort and plenty of foreign lobbying, Dublin could be the next London."
 IRE_industrial_research_priorities: "工业研究优先"
 IRE_industrial_research_priorities_desc: "Our national has a vital need for industry, and that need is coupled with an equal requirement for research and development. Many of our factories are decrepit and out of date. To build a modern industry, Ireland needs modern factories. Investing into industrial research will allow us to move further towards progress."
 IRE_synthetic_fuel_project: "Irish Synthetic Fuel Project"
 IRE_synthetic_fuel_project_desc: "Although our people are industrious and our island ripe for industrialisation, there is no accounting for the unfortunate lack of natural resources available to us relative to the major powers of the world. Oil and rubber are particularly problematic, so if we would like to make use of these resources in our industries, Ireland must develop a functional synthetics programme."
 IRE_scientific_innovation_council: "Éireann Scientific Innovation Council"
 IRE_scientific_innovation_council_desc: "Our nation is greatly lacking in scientific progress compared to many other industrialised nations. Presently Ireland has very little in the way of funding for scientific research. Beginning to develop a proper scientific programme will be essential if we are to significantly develop our nation."
 IRE_immigration_reform: "移民改革"
 IRE_immigration_reform_desc: "The Irish population are eager and willing to work, but our nation is a small one. The state of our economy to date has been rather unimpressive and uninviting, but with the recent developments spurred on by the IEAA, perhaps we can begin improving this situation. Irish business would grow more quickly if we encouraged immigration from other less developed nations."
 IRE_improved_safety_regulations: "Improved Safety Regulations Act"
 IRE_improved_safety_regulations_desc: "Industrial accidents, factory sicknesses and other mishaps are frighteningly common in Irish industry. The lack of proper safety standards has been a cause for great concern among the workers and has seen them turn increasingly towards Syndicalism. We can all agree that no worker should feel like his workplace is a dangerous environment. It's time to make a change."
 IRE_women_in_workplace: "Irish Women in the Workplace"
 IRE_women_in_workplace_desc: "Ireland has in the past been a principally conservative nation, held in thrall to the Catholic church. Irish republicanism and nationalist movements have begun to influence opinions however, and there is a growing demand for women to be emancipated from the home and granted more independence, creating more employable workers and boosting our economy."
 IRE_national_tax_reform: "国家税收改革"
 IRE_national_tax_reform_desc: "With the rapid economic change in our country, it's time that we start addressing our taxation laws. A modern tax plan will allow the government more economic freedom to make decisions for our nation. Of course, any such plan needs to be considered carefully, we wouldn't want to overtax the Irish people."
 IRE_foreign_exploitation_contracts: "外国开采合同"
 IRE_foreign_exploitation_contracts_desc: "Ireland only has a few natural resources and many of them have very few military applications. There is a whole wide world out there however, and Irish resource industries could theoretically be set up in the colonial possessions of friendly nations in order to harvest rare materials to fuel our industry and create a hefty profit."
 IRE_questions_of_the_day: "Political Questions of the Day"
 IRE_questions_of_the_day_desc: "Despite having gained our freedom from the tyranny of British rule, Ireland is a divided nation and there are many great questions that occupy the mind of the public and politicians alike. We must address these questions if our nation is going to be able to pull itself together to form a true whole."
 IRE_uniting_the_nation: "Uniting the Nation"
 IRE_uniting_the_nation_desc: "Some of the chief divisions of our nation could be addressed through a programme of cultural reform. Spreading the Irish language will help unite our countrymen, whilst addressing the long-standing hold of the Catholic church over Irish values and morality would be a progressive move. Our youth could see benefit in a scouts scheme, and perhaps our immigrant population can be better integrated with some effort."
 IRE_dealing_with_church: "Dealing with the Church"
 IRE_dealing_with_church_desc: "The status of the Church has long been in question since the declaration of Irish independence. Ostensibly, the Irish Republic is a secular nation, but some have questioned whether that is true. It's time to officially resolve the question of the Church once and for all in legislation, and with it direct the future of the nation."
 IRE_promote_irish_language: "Promote the Irish Language"
 IRE_promote_irish_language_desc: "The Irish Gaelic language is widely spoken in Ireland, but it has slowly decayed over time during the British rule, and in some areas it is now no longer spoken at all. We could better unite our people and preserve our cultural heritage by encouraging the use of Gaeilge throughout the nation."
 IRE_irish_scouts: "爱尔兰童子军"
 IRE_irish_scouts_desc: "Young Irish boys and girls often find themselves with very little to do in our society, and have often been left to their own devices as their parents work long toils in our factories and businesses. We could follow the example of the Americans with their Boy Scouts and create an organisation of our own, instilling our youth with an understanding for Irish culture and honourable values."
 IRE_on_the_world_stage: "Éire on the World Stage"
 IRE_on_the_world_stage_desc: "For eleven years since the end of the British Revolution, Ireland has existed in a sleepy isolation, the politics of the outside world not seen as important. Now however with a second Weltkrieg on the horizon Ireland must assert itself the world stage or be consumed once more."
 IRE_ancestral_ties: "血脉相连"
 IRE_ancestral_ties_desc: "Millions of Irish-Americans live in the United States of America, descendants of Irish men and women fleeing British oppression and famine. With many in the diaspora being in powerful positions, we can use our ancestral connections to influence the US government and its policies."
 IRE_improve_integration: "Improve Integration for Irish-Americans"
 IRE_improve_integration_desc: "The refugee population that we have received from North America have been welcomed for the most part with open arms by their Irish brothers and sisters. But there is always bound to be tensions and difficulties for such a large group of people trying to make their way in a new land. We can take measures to better integrate the Irish-Americans into our society."
 IRE_attract_fleeing_intellectuals: "Attract Stateless Intellectuals"
 IRE_attract_fleeing_intellectuals_desc: "Whether through war or persecution, many talented individuals find themselves cast adrift, searching for nothing more than to find somewhere safe to live without fear. Thanks to the relative stability of our nation we find ourselves very attractive as a prospective destination. By attracting these foreign intellectuals we can encourage them to use their skills to improve the Irish economy and research facilities."
 IRE_reforming_armed_forces: "Reforming the Armed Forces"
 IRE_reforming_armed_forces_desc: "Since the end of the British Revolution, the Irish military has fallen into stagnation, and suffered from downsizing as the Union of Britain and Canada appeared less threatening. As international tensions are growing, the military must be revitalised."
 IRE_heavy_industrial_focus: "重视重工业"
 IRE_heavy_industrial_focus_desc: "Ireland is a small nation and can only spare so much space for a military arms complex. The military factories that we do build need to be built specialised for war, able to run efficient production lines and generate a high degree of output. We cannot waste our time with converting civilian factories into war-machines."
 IRE_heavy_production_drive: "大生产运动"
 IRE_heavy_production_drive_desc: "Faster, harder, and stronger: that's quickly becoming the ethos of the Irish military industry. We may not outnumber our enemies, but we will do our best to outproduce them."
 IRE_define_industrial_strategy: "Define the Industrial Strategy"
 IRE_define_industrial_strategy_desc: "Strategic decisions are made beyond the battlefield, too. Just as our generals must decide our army's priorities, so too must we decide upon our industrial strategy. A bi-annual committee will be set up to review our priorities and allow us to focus our production efforts on one major production line, increasing its output significantly."
 IRE_medium_industrial_focus: "重视中等工业"
 IRE_medium_industrial_focus_desc: "To adapt to the ever-changing environment, it is vital that the Irish arms industry stays flexible. We might expect to be at war eventually, but that war will not last forever. We need to be able to adapt our industrial economy to war and peace in equal measure, and a medium industrial focus will do just that, with cheaper and more flexible military factories."
 IRE_maintain_flexibility: "维持弹性"
 IRE_maintain_flexibility_desc: "Our military factories are designed to be cheap, quick to build, and easily torn down and converted when needs be. The same ethos should apply to what we build on them. New lines need to get up and running immediately and being able to swap and start on the fly will be of great asset for this 'mobile' industrial strategy."
 IRE_industrial_defence_plan: "工业防御计划"
 IRE_industrial_defence_plan_desc: "It's vital that our military industry not be crippled by enemy bombers during war-time. By constructing elaborate defence systems to protect our military factories, we will be able to minimise the damage done through enemy bombers."
 IRE_military_industry: "军事工业"
 IRE_military_industry_desc: "Whilst the people of Ireland would prefer peace to war, there is no doubt that war may very well be on the horizon. With an enemy across the Irish Sea and more still waiting in the wings, Ireland must build her military industry if she hopes to survive the coming storm."
 IRE_naval_industry_focus: "重视海军工业"
 IRE_naval_industry_focus_desc: "If Ireland is construct a fleet of any particular relevance then she will quickly need to start constructing new naval facilities. Investment into the naval industry of our nation will be a step in the right direction towards protecting the Irish Sea, and our nation itself, against foreign aggression."
 IRE_cork_submarine_foundry: "科克潜艇制造厂"
 IRE_cork_submarine_foundry_desc: "Some of our naval theorists believe that submarines might very well be the naval weapons of the future. If we want to heed their advice, then we'd better start producing more of them. By developing a specialised submarine foundry and testing facility in Cork, we can focus our naval production on the development of these predator undersea ships."
 IRE_belfast_capital_shipwright: "贝尔法斯特主力舰造船厂"
 IRE_belfast_capital_shipwright_desc: "Small ships and submarines are children's toys in comparison to the mighty visage of a battleship. If we're going to be taken seriously as any sort of naval power, we need to produce big, powerful ships. Belfast is the perfect place to start."
 IRE_dublin_destroyer_shipyard: "都柏林驱逐舰造船厂"
 IRE_dublin_destroyer_shipyard_desc: "Screens play a key role in any naval strategy. Ireland might not have much of a fleet to speak of at present, but our admirals know the basics. Whatever type of fleet we are likely to produce, screens will be important. A shipyard in Dublin could be adapted to focus upon the development of destroyers and light cruisers."
 IRE_an_taerchor: "An tAerchór"
 IRE_an_taerchor_desc: "One glaring error of the Irish military so far has been the lack of any air force, seen as too unimportant and expensive. With the British building one of the largest air forces in the world, it is vital that we correct this if we are to stand a chance."
 IRE_protect_eire_from_above: "Protect Éire from Above"
 IRE_protect_eire_from_above_desc: "In the event of a war, the British air force would be able to invade Ireland's skies with impunity. We must research aircraft that can prevent this and shoot any tresspassing British planes out of the sky."
 IRE_defend_the_irish_sea: "Defend the Irish Sea"
 IRE_defend_the_irish_sea_desc: "Britain's historical strength has been its navy, with which it could defend its island from invasion. The best way to cripple Britain's power and protect Ireland from a British landing would be to research and build a series of bombers capable of destroying ships."
 IRE_advanced_bombing_campaign: "进阶轰炸"
 IRE_advanced_bombing_campaign_desc: "Now that we have researched naval bombers, we should use our newfound knowledge to research other kinds of bombers that can help us take the fight to Great Britain."
 IRE_expand_our_airfields: "Expand our Airfields"
 IRE_expand_our_airfields_desc: "Currently our airfields in Dublin and Derry are subpar compared to those of many other nations, we must bring those airfields up to standard."
 IRE_radar_technology: "雷达科技"
 IRE_radar_technology_desc: "Now that we have built an air force for ourselves, we should investigate radar technology. This would allow us to detect enemy aircraft, making it easier for our planes to destroy them, as well as giving us intelligence on enemy troops and ships."
 IRE_heavy_fighter_programme: "重型战斗机项目"
 IRE_heavy_fighter_programme_desc: "With our fighter research having been a success, we should now look into building heavy fighters, effective at a longer range than regular fighters and adept at destroying enemy bombers."
 IRE_women_in_the_iraf: "Women In The IRAF"
 IRE_women_in_the_iraf_desc: "While many have been opposed to the inclusion of women in the Irish army or navy despite the service of the Cumann na mBan during the Easter Rising, attitudes are more open to allowing them to enlist in the air force, perhaps following famous American pilot Amelia Earhart's example."
 IRE_an_tarm: "An tArm"
 IRE_an_tarm_desc: "Military tactics and doctrines have changed since the War of Independence. The Irish army on the other hand has not. It is essential that we stay up to date when the outbreak of war in Europe is looking more and more likely by the day."
 IRE_honourable_army: "An Honourable Army"
 IRE_honourable_army_desc: "Our army must be focused on order, discipline, and defence. While these tactics may have failed during the Easter Rising, they are a better fit for conventional warfare."
 IRE_peoples_army: "A People's Army"
 IRE_peoples_army_desc: "Our army must be focused on speed and quick planning, adapting some of the tactics that allowed us to defeat the British during the Irish War of Independence to conventional warfare."
 IRE_establish_officer_school: "Establish an Officer School"
 IRE_establish_officer_school_desc: "Currently, many officers in our army lack proper training as a result of our armed forces being descended from a guerrilla rather than a professional army. If we were to establish an officer training school which would train civilians and enlisted personnel in order for them to gain a commission as Irish officers, it would improve the quality of our military."
 IRE_patriotic_movement: "爱国运动"
 IRE_patriotic_movement_desc: "Now that we have decided to adapt our War of Independence tactics to the modern day, we should promote a campaign comparing the modern army to the Flying Columns and that we pioneered these tactics to invigorate a sense of national pride in our people."
 IRE_professional_army: "A Professional Army"
 IRE_professional_army_desc: "Now that we have decided to move to a more professional army, we must train our soldiers and officers, many of whom are still accustomed to the strategies of yesteryear."
 IRE_the_fighting_irish: "战斗的爱尔兰人"
 IRE_the_fighting_irish_desc: "While some of our forces are having trouble adapting to our decision, many Irishmen, some in Ireland and some outside, have fought for armies such as the American or British armies. We could hire their help to assist in training our troops."
 IRE_mobile_warfare: "机动作战"
 IRE_mobile_warfare_desc: "Military strategy is changing, with mobility and tank warfare becoming popular. We too must keep up with the times, and begin studying mobility doctrines."
 IRE_motorising_the_saighdiuri: "Motorising the Saighdiúirí"
 IRE_motorising_the_saighdiuri_desc: "If mobility warfare is to work our regular infantry must be motorised so as to outrun the enemy otherwise our spearheads will be left stranded and vulnerable to encirclement themselves."
 IRE_armour_advances: "装甲发展"
 IRE_armour_advances_desc: "Tanks are key to mobile warfare, forming the spearhead of an encirclement of the enemy. We must research tanks if our mobility tactics are to be successful."
 IRE_womens_auxiliary: "Women's Auxiliary"
 IRE_womens_auxiliary_desc: "Women have much to contribute to our nation and its defence. We must open positions to those brave daughters of Ireland who would serve their country."
 IRE_superior_firepower: "优势火力"
 IRE_superior_firepower_desc: "The new mobility doctrine is primarily for nations that intend to invade others, which Ireland has no need of. Our doctrine should be focused on the use of artillery and preserving the lives of our men."
 IRE_small_arms_focus: "重视轻武器"
 IRE_small_arms_focus_desc: "An army cannot fight without supplies or ammunition. While German supplies and American donations proved helpful during the War of Independence, we must learn to research and produce our own supplies."
 IRE_dublin_arsenal: "The Dublin Arsenal"
 IRE_dublin_arsenal_desc: "Our doctrine depends on producing artillery so as to preserve the lives of our men. As we cannot just depend on just buying from international munitions companies we must study how to produce artillery ourselves."
 IRE_fortify_the_shannon: "Fortify the Shannon"
 IRE_fortify_the_shannon_desc: "One of Ireland's key natural landmarks is the River Shannon, dividing the east and west of Ireland. Our military has proposed fortifying both sides of the river, so that we can hold the line along the Shannon in the event of an enemy invasion."
 IRE_anti_air_batteries: "Anti-Air Batteries"
 IRE_anti_air_batteries_desc: "Despite the grave threat that the British air force poses to Ireland, we have been slow to build any defences against them in the event of a declaration of war. This must change, and quickly."
 IRE_tearmann_citadel_project: "Tearmann - The Citadel Project"
 IRE_tearmann_citadel_project_desc: "While we have focused on fortifying the coasts and the rivers, the cities themselves have remained somewhat unprotected. We have come up with a plan known as the Citadel Project, the first stage of the project would be to erect land forts in our major cities protecting them from assault."
 IRE_citadel_dublin: "都柏林堡垒"
 IRE_citadel_dublin_desc: "The second stage of the plan is to completely fortify Dublin with forts, anti-aircraft equipment, coastal forts and radar. We must either choose to secure Dublin or Belfast as we don't have the resources to fortify both."
 IRE_citadel_belfast: "贝尔法斯特堡垒"
 IRE_citadel_belfast_desc: "The second stage of the plan is to completely fortify Belfast with forts, anti-aircraft equipment, coastal forts and radar. We must either choose to secure Belfast or Dublin as we don't have the resources to fortify both."

 IRE_an_tseirbhis: "An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh"
 IRE_an_tseirbhis_desc: "Despite being an island nation and neighbouring to Britain, our navy only consists of a few destroyers mainly used for search and rescue of drowning fishermen. If we are to stand a chance against Britain's famous navy, we will need to expand."
 IRE_screen_research_project: "屏卫舰研究计划"
 IRE_screen_research_project_desc: "The purpose of a screen is to scout for a fleet and protect it from submarines and aircraft, something that would be useful in detecting British submarines and especially Britain's infamous RAF."
 IRE_doctrinal_innovation: "学说创新"
 IRE_doctrinal_innovation_desc: "New doctrines are vital for modern war, so we should focus on them."
 IRE_muirshaighdiuiri: "Muirshaighdiúirí"
 IRE_muirshaighdiuiri_desc: "Now that we have expanded our navy, we should consider the training of an elite unit of marines to spearhead a land invasion. If this was to be successful we could finally take the 700 years fight for Irish freedom to British land."
 IRE_wolfhounds_on_irish_sea: "Wolfhounds of the Irish Sea"
 IRE_wolfhounds_on_irish_sea_desc: "During the Weltkrieg despite being outclassed by the British Navy, the Germans used U-Boats to great effect. Our first step should be to research submarine tactics so that we can also replicate this success."
 IRE_second_fenian_ram: "The Second Fenian Ram"
 IRE_second_fenian_ram_desc: "In 1881 Irish inventor John Phillip Holland created a submarine known as the Holland Boat No. II, nicknamed the Fenian Ram, for the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Now we must follow in their footsteps and build a submarine fleet of our own to defend ourselves against the British Navy."
 IRE_grand_fleet: "A Grand Fleet for Ireland"
 IRE_grand_fleet_desc: "If we are to stand up to the British, we must be able to build a fleet similar to their own. While this will take a long time it will pay off in the end, just as it did for Germany which once also had a far inferior fleet to the British."
 IRE_better_battleships: "更好的战列舰"
 IRE_better_battleships_desc: "Now that we have begun to build a grand fleet to match the British, we should look into the building of a Super-Heavy Battleship. While it will take a long time to build and will be expensive, the results should be worth it."
