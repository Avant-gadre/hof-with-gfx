 GXC_infantry_equipment_0: "粤造 八八式步枪"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_0_short: "广东八八式"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "最初为光绪朝后期自强运动事业的产物，八八式步枪是以德国Gew.88步枪的出口修改版为蓝本设计的。尽管相比其蓝本有所改进，但其总体上还是比不上新式步枪。虽然该枪很难得到维护而且枪身笨重，但这一武器的优点就在于坚固耐用而且使用可靠。\n\n该款步枪主要由广东兵工厂仿制生产；尽管由于装备短缺和个人喜好原因，我们经常能看到其与各类非正规武器混在一起使用，比如大刀。"

 GXC_infantry_equipment_1_short: "广东二七式"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "该步枪的官方名称为“宣统二十七年式”。得益于大清复辟之后的德国援助，该款步枪于1935年进入部队服役。这款武器从功能上看几乎就是德国毛瑟M1924的复制品，在重量和后坐力方面比老旧的八八式步枪有了长足的改进。\n\n主要是在汉阳兵工厂用德国机械生产的二七式步枪的生产技艺已经流传到了广东，即使它可能在短时间内不会取代它的先辈。"

 GXC_infantry_equipment_3: "粤造 辛亥三十三年式步枪"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_3_short: "广东三三式"
 GXC_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "辛亥三三式步枪是一款基于1914年时的“刘式步枪”设计制造的自动装填步枪。虽然二者外观很相似，但是宣统三五式的枪长更短，机匣后半部也加装了机匣盖；刘式步枪复杂的气井集气系统也被一个简单的导气孔所取代——这让新步枪再也不能切换到非自动射击模式。同时辛亥三三式步枪也采用了波希米亚ZH-29步枪和ZB-26轻机枪所使用的弹匣。"

 GXC_armored_car_equipment_1: "粤造 六轮战斗车辆"
 GXC_armored_car_equipment_1_short: "六轮战车"
 GXC_armored_car_equipment_1_desc: "在第二次美国内战爆发后，许多美国的军用GMC六轮卡车进入了国际军火市场。两广军阀很快发觉了这个机会，采购了一小批这类卡车，将其改建为装甲车。\n\n这批装甲车装有一个可旋转的重机枪炮塔，炮塔下方则是一门对准车身正前方的37mm步兵炮，同时在车身两侧分别加装了两挺轻机枪。考虑到中国战场的交战烈度，这种装甲车的体量和火力对遭遇它的其他军阀来说无异于“怪物”。"
