She has demonstrated considerable skill in mock dogfights, but there are many within the military establishment who frown on the idea of a having a woman flying combat missions.

 usa.4.t: "Destroyers for Bases Agreement"
 usa.4.d: "Having taken a stance against the Germans, the US appear interested in ensuring Britain stands strong against the German threat. They are, however, also concerned with maintaining their own naval presence in the Atlantic. In exchange for several of our naval bases, they will supply our nation with destroyer ships. The ships have been in reserve, but accepting will still strengthen the military bonds between our nations, and may be a wise decision."
 usa.4.a: "This is a unique opportunity."
 usa.4.a.tt: "We will gain 43 American Destroyers.\nCanada will gain 7 American Destroyers."

 usa.401.desc: "British Prime Minister [From.GetLeader] has signaled his acceptance of the terms of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. A group of [From.GetAdjective] naval officers has arrived to inspect the destroyers and oversee the transfer.\n\n There is evidently still some work to do as several [From.GetAdjective] officers seem a little concerned about the sheer amount and thickness of guano and rust on the ships to be transfered."

 usa.22.d: "The [From.GetName]'s advocation for fascism is starting to affect our country. Radio broadcasts allow speeches from [From.GetLeader] to reach our people and we have even found propaganda leaflets promoting the [From.GetAdjective] way of life being distributed in some parts of the country.

Is American communism just another tool [Root.GetLeader] has used to consolidate power?"
 usa.24.a: "Return to Democracy."
 usa.24.b: "Stay true to Communism."
 usa.40.t: "Senator votes for Government Proposal"
 usa.40.desc: "In a recent vote, a senator has surprisingly switched sides to vote for a government proposal. While the issue itself was fairly minor, the public vote of support from a previously outspoken critic of [USA.GetLeader] has raised many eyebrows around Washington.\n\nSome analysts believe that this example will lead additional senators to reconsider their stance."
 usa.40.a: "A useful ally."
 usa.41.t: "Representative speaks passionately in support of Government"
 usa.41.desc: "Asked about her stance on a number of policy issues at a fund-raising dinner, a representative spoke out in support of President [USA.GetLeader]'s policies. She further claimed that many of her fellow representatives had similar views, but were merely held back by \"idiotic short-sightedness, thinking no further than the next election\" instead of doing what was right for the American people. \n\nHer comments have been widely reported by the press and put several of her colleagues in hot water as they had to explain where they stood on these issues."
 usa.41.a: "She is right, you know."
 usa.42.t: "Senator speaks out against Government Policy"
 usa.42.desc: "A Senator has given an interview in a major newspaper, saying that he can no longer support the \"foolish and dangerous\" policies of President [USA.GetLeader].

 usa.43.t: "Representative criticizes President"
 usa.43.desc: "During a recent debate on tax reform, a Representative launched into a long-winded speech about the many failings of the Administration. According to him, no right-thinking American could possibly want to support the policies of the President, whatever their party affiliation may be. \n\nHis harsh words seem to have had an effect, as a number of Representatives previously thought firmly behind the policies of [USA.GetLeader] made noises of support."
 usa.43.a: "Disgraceful."
 usa.44.t: "Opposition suffers defeat in the Senate"
 usa.44.desc: "A motion to censure President [USA.GetLeader] has been defeated in the Senate. While even its most ardent supporters had little hope that it would pass, the amount of votes against it came as a shock even to the most pessimistic of observers. It appears that the President enjoys a far greater level of support in the Senate than most believed, which should help in advancing his legislative agenda."
 usa.44.a: "Great."
 usa.45.t: "House Committee supports Presidential Policy"
 usa.45.desc: "The latest round of hearings in the House Committee on Ways and Means has resulted in a report crediting the President's policies with a major improvements in all available metrics of the economy. While stopping short of outright praise, the report nevertheless comes as a blow to those that were criticizing the President and demanding reforms.\n\nA number of Representatives have already publicly declared that although they still harbour doubts about the President's agenda, they will now vote in support."
 usa.45.a: "As well they should."
 usa.46.t: "Senator retires"
 usa.46.desc: "Following a minor heart attack, a senior Senator announced today that he will be retiring for health reasons. With more than two decades in Congress, the Senator built a large network of supporters and his influence carried a lot of weight. While technically only one man with one vote, Washington insiders nonetheless counted him as worth several votes as he was the key to secure several others. \n\nWith the seat most likely going to an avowed critic of President [USA.GetLeader], the Administration will find it a lot harder to secure the necessary votes to pass bills."
 usa.46.a: "He will be missed. And his vote as well."
 usa.47.t: "House hearings into Presidential misconduct"
 usa.47.desc: "A minor scandal originating in the White House has started to gain momentum. Following weeks of media reports implying that a minor administrative official had been taking bribes in return for lucrative government contracts, the House Committee on Expenditures in the Executive has begun to hold hearings to determine if the President was aware of this. While most observers don't believe that this will lead to any major trouble for President [USA.GetLeader], it will no doubt mean that many of the president's supporters will have to lay low for a while."
 usa.47.a: "A witchhunt."

 baltic.1.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] is pressuring us to sign a 'mutual assistance' treaty with them, which would give them the right to station forces inside our territory!

After much soul searching his majesty has chosen love over duty and has chosen to abdicate. His younger brother, Albert, will assume the mantle as King George VI.

 china.1.t: "The Marco Polo Bridge Incident"
 china.1.d: "Japanese soldiers recently launched an attack on the strategic Marco Polo Bridge just south of Beijing, but they were repelled by our brave soldiers.

 china.1.b: "We can ill afford a war with Japan."
 china.2.t: "Germany Withdraws Advisors"

 china.7.t: "Kuomintang Launch Offensive"
 china.7.d: "Although we have escaped certain defeat through the Long March, the nationalists are not planning to let us grow stronger without more confrontations. Our spies suggest they are mounting an offensive against us, which could weaken our political support if we try to retreat further.\n\nWe don't know how committed the Kuomintang are to pushing us back right now. Trying to confront them carries significant risks. If the local warlords have been rallied to support the attack, our chances may be slim. On the other hand, retreating now when we have finally stopped may not be an option."

 china.11.t: "Defeat Against the Kuomintang"

 china.11.a: "We will recover and win the faith of the people again."
 china.12.t: "Victory Against the Kuomintang"

 france.19.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses French Alliance"
 france.19.d: "Despite our best efforts to offer support to the Little Entente, our most recent attempt to reach out to one of the nations has been met with skepticism.

 france.20.t: "Resistance to the armistice"
 france.20.d: "In the wake of the French armistice with Germany and establishment of a new government in Vichy France, a group of senior officers have rebelled against the new French government.

Germany has earned our trust in the honoring of our Naval Pact, and while we will defend ourselves should the fires spread we will not risk fanning the flames. Peace must always be the goal of any democratic nation.'\n\nOur request to join Britain as Allies has been denied.

Elements within the government want an armistice with Germany, but many officers wish to continue the struggle from Britain.\n\nCertain members of the British War Cabinet have suggested another option - a merger of France and Great Britain into a single nation, which will fight on until all of France has been liberated."

 germany.4.a: "How can anyone say that Austria is not German?!"
 germany.6.t: "The Tripartite Pact"
 germany.6.d: "The signees consider it as the condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations in the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned."

 germany.11.t: "The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"
 germany.11.d: "The German Foreign Ministry have proposed a non-aggression pact between our two nations. This treaty will greatly increase our mutual trade, and an additional secret protocol suggests the division of Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres.\n\nWhile the fascists in Berlin may not be trustworthy, this pact will allow us to deal with Finland, the Baltic States and Romania without fear of outside interference. The eastern territories of Poland will also befall us in the event of a Polish collapse."

This means that we are free to act without risk of Soviet intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, some of our friends now question Germany's commitment towards the ultimate destruction of communism. When matters with Poland and France have been settled, we may need to revisit this treaty, but that is a discussion for another time..."
 germany.12.a: "Excellent."
 germany.13.t: "Moscow Rejects the Pact"
 germany.13.d: "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has refused to sign our non-aggression pact! This complicates matters, since we cannot deal decisively with Poland or France without the risk of the Bolsheviks getting themselves involved."
 germany.13.a: "Curse them!"
 germany.14.t: "The Partitioning of Poland"
 germany.14.d: "Poland is ours, but the eastern parts fall under the [SOU.GetAdjective] sphere of influence according to the stipulations of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Should we withdraw our forces and let the [SOU.GetAdjective]s occupy this territory? Failure to do so would render our treaty void."

 germany.14.b: "No! All of Poland belongs to the Vaterland!"

 germany.20.t: "Second Vienna Award"
 germany.20.d: "Recognizing that a new order has been established in Europe, we have been asked by Hungary and Romania to arbitrate in a territorial dispute between the two countries.

 germany.22.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our demands, and Memel will be incorporated back into East Prussia. Yet another unlawfully stolen province has been returned to the German nation!"
 germany.22.a: "Excellent."
 germany.23.t: "Memel - [FROM.GetNameDef] Refuses Demand"
 germany.23.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our demands! They are hiding behind the Klaipeda Convention, claiming that Germany has no legal right to the Memel territory. We shall have to explain our position to them by different means..."
 germany.23.a: "Stubborn fools."
 germany.24.t: "German Military Mission to China"
 germany.24.d: "Germany has enjoyed good relations with China since the end of the previous Weltkrieg, despite the loss of our Chinese possessions. A German military mission has been present in China for a number of years, and Alexander von Falkenhausen has made great progress in reforming parts of the Kuomintang army.\n\nThis is naturally of some concern to the Japanese, given their present war against China. They are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all German support to the Chinese."
 germany.24.a: "Recall von Falkenhausen."
 germany.24.b: "No, our advisors will stay."
 germany.24.c: "No, our advisors will stay, just as we have promised the Chinese."
 germany.25.t: "Military Advisors Recalled"

 germany.25.a: "We shall put him to work."
 germany.26.t: "China Detains Military Advisors"
 germany.26.d: "Germany and China are in a state of war, and the Chinese have consequently detained the German military advisors that were reforming their army. Von Falkenhausen and a few of his officers managed to elude capture, and are now on their way back to Europe."

 germany.28.t: "Germans press for Anschluss"
 germany.28.d: "Civil unrest and acts of violence have broken out as protesters voice their desire for Austria to join Germany in a union of German peoples. Berlin is pressing hard for an Anschluss, which would see Austria annexed into their nation."
 germany.28.a: "We shall join the German Reich!"
 germany.28.b: "No, Austria's destiny lies elsewhere."
 germany.29.t: "Austria refuses the Anschluss!"
 germany.29.d: "The fools in Vienna have refused to accept the merger of our two nations! This is a blatant disregard for the will of the Austrian people, and it will not stand! We may have to enforce the Anschluss through military means."

 germany.40.t: "The Munich Conference"
 germany.40.d: "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis. What will the British position be?"
 germany.40.d_2: "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. As we have already proven that we won't accept German expansionism, this means we now have another ally in the war against Germany."
 germany.40.a: "The Czechs are on their own."
 germany.40.b: "Czechoslovakia must be defended!"
 germany.51.t: "First Vienna Award"
 germany.51.d: "Czechoslovakia is a cancer tumor in the heart of Europe, and at last the Germans have decided to take decisive action against them. The Sudetenland has already been surrendered to Germany, and now, as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, the Czechoslovakian territory that rightfully belongs to Hungary is to be returned to us."
 germany.51.a: "About time!"
 germany.52.t: "The Annexation of Zaolzie"
 germany.52.d: "Czechoslovakia is falling apart, and we must act quickly to protect territory with significant Polish populations before it can be seized by Germany. Czech ownership of Zaolzie has always been contested by us, and it is time for the region to join our nation."

 germany.53.t: "The Fate of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.53.d: "Not content with stealing the Sudetenland, the Germans have now decided to seize the rest of our nation. Abandoned by our so-called allies, and with our best defenses lost in the Munich Diktat, the situation appears hopeless..."

 germany.53.b: "...yet still we must resist!"
 germany.54.t: "The Czechs Resist"
 germany.54.d: "The Czechs have somehow mustered the courage to fight our occupation of their country. Their best defenses were in the Sudetenland, which is now under our control, so this should be a swift campaign."
 germany.54.a: "Prague will soon be ours."
 germany.55.d: "The end of Czechoslovakia is at hand, and our forces are marching into Prague at this very moment. With the surrender of the Czechoslovakian military, we have liberated vast quantities of armaments. Their tanks, in particular, should serve our forces well.\n\nBöhmen will be annexed into Germany as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.d_2: "Having conquered Czechoslovakia, we must consider the best way to split up these territories.\n\nBöhmen remains German as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.a: "Set up Slovakia as a puppet state."
 germany.55.b: "Partition Czechoslovakia with Hungary."
 germany.55.c: "All of Czechoslovakia belongs to the Reich!"
 germany.55.do: "Honor the promise to Hungary."
 germany.56.t: "The Partition of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.56.d: "German forces have entered Prague and the end of Czechoslovakia is imminent. They intend to annex Bohemia into the German Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.d_2: "After annexing Czechoslovakia, Germany is intending to retain Bohemia as part of the Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."

 germany.56.b: "No, we do not need Slovakia or German friendship."
 germany.57.t: "Hungary Rejects Our Offer"
 germany.57.d: "The Hungarians have outrageously refused our generous offer to annex Slovakia, claiming they have no interest in the region! We will have to deal with them soon enough. For now, we must come up with a solution to the Slovakian Question."

 germany.57.b: "Annex Slovakia into Germany."
 germany.58.t: "The Polish Question"
 germany.58.d: "The Reichsministerium of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda has done an excellent job, and the people of Germany - indeed, the entire world - has been informed of the injustices our German brethren in Poland are forced to endure. We now have all the justification we need for a war!"
 germany.58.a: "Soon Poland will be no more!"
 germany.74.t: "Preparing the Ground"
 germany.74.d: "The Austrians are yearning to become part of the German Reich, but the stubborn government in Vienna has so far resisted all attempts to bring about a union. We must increase support for fascism in Austria. The Austrian Nazi Party will then become a viable alternative to the ruling austrofascists.\n\nAn Abwehr agent has been made available for an espionage mission. Use him to covertly increase popular support for fascism in Austria."
 germany.74.a: "Austria will be ours!"
 germany.75.t: "German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.75.d: "Despite harsh previous rhetoric against both the people and the ideological leadership of the [Root.GetName], [From.GetLeader] and Germany has now reached out to us, requesting a mutually beneficial research treaty. While exchanging knowledge would help our efforts to develop new tank designs along with promises of other research benefits in the future, there is little doubt considering previous statements that the Germans are doing this for their own sake. Should we go forward with the agreement despite the risk of aiding [From.GetLeader]'s ambitions?"
 germany.75.a: "The capitalists are a worse threat to us both."
 germany.75.b: "We won't give fascists the weapons to crush the proletariat!"
 germany.77.t: "Soviets Reject German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.77.d: "The [From.GetName] has rejected our suggestion for a treaty aimed at advancing armored unit research in both countries, presumably fearing our superior weapons would be turned against them."
 germany.77.a: "They have hardly diminished the risks of it now."
 germany.78.t: "German Joint Air Research"
 germany.78.d: "As stipulated by the treaty with Germany, some of their special research projects share discoveries with our engineers. A recent breakthrough in radar technology has come to our attention, opening up unexpected opportunities to advance our research in the field."
 germany.78.a: "Detecting the enemy is the first step."
 germany.79.t: "Ultimatum from Germany"
 germany.79.d: "With Greece under the thumb of Germany, [From.GetLeader] has put pressure on our government to join their ranks. The Soviet-German alliance has put us in a position where neutrality is no longer an option, and now an ultimatum has arrived from Berlin demanding we cede our eastern territories to their Soviet allies and join them in the very pact they are using to force our hand.\n\nAlthough we cannot maintain neutrality, there are other options. Seeking support from Britain is one, standing our ground is another. None, however, can secure the future of the republic with certainty."
 germany.79.a: "If we work with the Germans, we may find the opportunity to reclaim other land."
 germany.79.b: "We can count on British support, and they can count on us."
 germany.79.c: "If these despots want to take our home, they have to fight for it."
 germany.80.t: "Danzig for Slovakia"
 germany.80.d: "The Germans have long had their eyes on Danzig, seeking to unite their territories in Ostpreussen with the rest of the German nation. Diplomats have warned that the day may come when they make us choose between Danzig or war.\n\nSurprisingly, we have been presented with what the Germans consider a more peaceful solution. They offer the newly created state of Slovakia, currently little more than a puppet state under German rule, to us in exchange for Danzig. \nWhat steps the Germans will take if we decline is unknown, but we have been given an opportunity to resolve this conflict with some territorial gains."
 germany.80.a: "This is the best offer we'll get."
 germany.80.b: "We will not give what is rightfully ours for what they have stolen!"
 germany.81.t: "Danzig Ceded for Slovakia"
 germany.81.d: "Poland has agreed to the exchange wherein Danzig will be ceded to [GER.GetNameDef], while Slovakia will now be under Polish control. Through this agreement, we have reclaimed Danzig while maintaining cordial, or at least not openly hostile, relations with our eastern neighbor."
 germany.81.a: "Germany is one again."
 germany.82.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to give up Danzig"
 germany.82.d: "Our generous offer of Slovakian territories to [From.GetNameDef] in exchange for Danzig has been rejected, leaving Danzig in Polish hands. Clearly, [From.GetLeader] does not share our understanding of Danzig as rightfully German territory. \n[Root.GetLeader] is furious, and the diplomatic options for reclaiming Danzig appear to have been exhausted."
 germany.82.a: "It may be time to consider other options."
 germany.83.t: "Anti-Soviet Pact"
 germany.83.d: "With the Anti-Comintern Pact, [From.GetNameDef] has secured fertile ground for diplomatic means of containing the Soviet menace. However, the pact does not constitute a military alliance, nor does it contain well-defined obligations for the signatories. [From.GetLeader] now seeks to extend the pact to an Anti-Soviet coalition, a binding agreement to join together in war if any signatory enters into a state of war with the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile substantially more dangerous, and likely to bring an end to any diplomacy we still maintain with the Soviets, this is also our chance to ensure that we have strong allies on our side in the case of war."
 germany.83.a: "We will stand by Germany and its allies against the Soviets."
 germany.83.b: "Anyone could start another world war with such a pact."
 germany.84.t: "Call Pact Members to War"
 germany.84.d: "Just as we suspected when we signed the Anti-Soviet Pact, we now find ourselves in a state of war with the Soviet Union. It is time for our co-signatories to honor their promise and join us."
 germany.84.a: "Our foresight pays off."
 germany.86.t: "Danzig or War"
 germany.86.d: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has long publicized their goal of reclaiming the territories they lost in the Great War. In particular they look to the territory of Danzig, which separates Ostpreussen from the rest of their nation. \n\nNow, they have demanded that Danzig be ceded to [GER.GetNameDef], and in exchange offer nothing but a promise to waive their claims on Poznan. With the threat of war looming, accepting the offer will delay a possible conflict, but at the cost of freely granting the Germans more strength for whatever lies ahead."
 germany.86.a: "Let's make a deal. Maybe they'll turn elsewhere."
 germany.86.b: "Danzig will remain Gdansk!"
 germany.87.t: "Poland Cedes Danzig"
 germany.87.d: "Faced with our ultimatum, Poland has agreed to give up their unjustly acquired territory to us, proving that they must have known it rightfully belonged to Germany!"
 germany.87.a: "Poland has avoided war... for now."
 germany.88.t: "Poland Refuses to Cede Danzig"
 germany.88.d: "Despite our attempts to allow Poland to hand over Danzig peacefully, even vowing to give up our claims on other German territories in exchange, we have been met with refusal. As expected, the world gives nothing to us that we do not seize by force."
 germany.88.a: "They know very well what the alternative is."
 germany.89.t: "Unholy Alliance"
 germany.89.d: "After the success of our recent cooperation, the Germans have come to us with an intriguing offer. They propose that we put our differences aside and instead of wasting our strength fighting each other while the western democracies watch and profit, we combine our strength and crush them instead!"
 germany.89.a: "Let the world tremble!"
 germany.89.b: "No deals with the Fascists!"
 germany.90.t: "Alliance refused"

 germany.91.t: "France wants to join our faction"
 germany.91.d: "The strong leaders of Mouvement Franciste have made great progress and offer to join our cause. The nation of France is ready to fight for the Reich."
 germany.91.a: "Mehr Soldaten für das Reich"
 germany.91.b: "Nein!"
 germany.92.t: "Germany Refuses Ultimatum"
 germany.92.d: "Despite our clarification that their re-militarization of the Rhineland would be viewed as an act of war, Germany has refused to back down and advanced into the demilitarized zone, ignoring our warning. This means that despite our best efforts to maintain peace, war has once again broken out in Europe."
 germany.92.a: "The Versailles Treaty must be enforced."
 germany.93.t: "London Conference"
 germany.93.d: "We expected the great powers of Europe to sit sound the table and come to equitable agreement in the name of peace. Instead the British and French have chosen to support the upstart Yugoslavs and their artificial state. Slovenia will be ours, one way or another...."

 germany.95.a: "Time to teach them a lesson"
 germany.96.t: "London Conference"
 germany.96.d: "The Yugoslavs, egged on by the foolish Italians, have decided to defy us. The ungrateful Italians will burn with the Yugoslavs. General Rommel assures us that they ran the last time, and no doubt they will run again."
 germany.96.a: "This war won't last long"
 germany.97.t: "London Conference"
 germany.97.d: "The great London Conference was supposed to right one of the many wrongs that have been done to Germany. The French, though, still thirst for revenge and only wish to see Germany on its knees. They backed the regime in Belgrade despite the justice of our cause. They honestly think their empty threats mean anything to us?"
 germany.97.a: "We will crush them both."
 germany.98.t: "The Fate of Yugoslavia"
 germany.98.d: "We always knew that the Yugoslav state carved out of the Hapsburg Empire was an artificial country fated never to last. The ethnic resentment simmering under the surface has boiled over and the state is falling apart. We must step in to rectify the situation."

 germany.100.b: "They need to earn our friendship"

An accomplished pilot, he apparently flew alone across the North Sea, taking care to stay out of radar range before veering west towards Britain.\nHess appears to have taken it upon himself to negotiate a peace treaty between Britain and Germany, although Berlin has denounced him as a madman and he has been stripped of all of his political offices. British authorities have not been available for comment."

The exact nature of his mission remains unclear - although Hess was an accomplished pilot, he flew alone and his airplane does not appear to have been armed.\nHis remains were recovered by British authorities, but a state funeral with an empty coffin has been scheduled in Berlin. \n\nHitler was reported as being visibly distraught by the death of his old friend."

I will not see petty politicking stand in the way of [yalta_partner.GetNameDef].\""
 germany.120.a: "This is worrisome."
 germany.126.t: "Anschluss or Destruction"
 germany.126.d: "Civil unrest and acts of violence have broken out as protesters voice their desire for Austria to join Germany. The internal struggles our nation already suffers from only adds to the voice of people wishing for a union with Germany. Berlin is pressing hard for an Anschluss and this may very well be our only chance to keep part of the true Austrian values alive."

 germany.999.t: "A tale of two cities"
 germany.999.desc: "Following the stunning victory of German forces, the time has come to destroy the last vestiges of Bolshevist rule in Europe. Even now, the names of Stalin and Lenin disgrace two major cities in the new German Lebensraum, mocking the soldiers who gave their lives to take them. \n\nThe \"Association of Veterans of the Weltkrieg\" have presented the government with a suggestion to rectify this horrible state of affairs."
 germany.999.a: "Let us honor the heroes of the last war!"
 germany.999.b: "What a preposterous suggestion!"

 hungary.1.t: "German Arbitration"
 hungary.1.d: "Despite our rightful claim, Germany has decided that Transylvania should remain under Romanian control. They say they are eager to right all the wrongs created at Versailles, but evidently this only holds true where their own borders are concerned."
 hungary.1.a: "Outrageous."
 hungary.2.t: "Second Vienna Award"
 hungary.2.d: "Germany has recognized the validity of our claim, as we knew they would, and Northern Transylvania has been returned to Hungary. This is a historic moment!"
 hungary.2.a: "A day to celebrate!"
 hungary.3.d: "Germany has not only recognized the validity of our claim, but they have decided that all of Transylvania is to be returned to Hungarian control! This is more than we had dared hope for."
 hungary.4.d: "Germany recognized the validity of our claim and awarded Northern Transylvania to us, but Romania has stubbornly refused to accept their decision!"
 hungary.4.a: "The fools!"
 hungary.5.d: "Germany recognized the validity of our claim and awarded all of Transylvania to us, but Romania has stubbornly refused to accept this decision!"
 hungary.6.t: "First Ljubljana Award"
 hungary.6.d: "The Germans may complain about the Treaty of Versailles but they got off lightly compared to the injustice of the Treaty of Trianon. Although they claimed it was about national self-determination, it condemned so many true sons of Hungary to foreign rule. One such wound on Hungarian pride is the province Vojvodina. The return of the lands back to Hungary have righted a wrong inflicted upon us."
 hungary.6.a: "Justice of Hungary"
 japan.1.d: "Chinese authorities claim that the 'breaking point' has been reached in regards to our 'unwarranted aggressions' towards China! Our demands for reparations have been refused, and there are reports of Japanese nationals coming under attack in Shanghai. If we needed an excuse to deal decisively with the Chinese, this is it!"
 japan.1.a: "They will pay for this!"
 japan.2.d: "Surprisingly, the Chinese have chosen to back down following the skirmish at the Marco Polo Bridge. They understand that angering us carries a steep price, and have agreed to extensive territorial concessions that include Beijing and its surrounding regions. Little by little, China is becoming ours."
 japan.2.a: "The war will have to wait."
 japan.11.t: "Issue Ultimatum to Siam"
 japan.11.d: "Amassing troops in Indochina, close to the Siamese border, we have made it clear that our intent to use their land as a base for freeing Southeast Asia from European colonialism is sincere. Hopefully, by allowing them the option of joining us in a military alliance, effectively making Siam a puppet state of the Japanese Empire, we can avoid a meaninglessly one-sided invasion. Of course, if they reject it, this will be tantamount to a declaration of war."
 japan.11.a: "We will enter Siam, regardless of what they say."
 japan.11.b: "In hindsight, threatening invasion is too aggressive."
 japan.12.t: "Japan Issues Ultimatum"
 japan.12.d: "Japan has been gathering forces close to our border for a long time and as suspected, their plan is to use our ports as bases for further expansion into Burma and Malaya. Now, they have presented us with the choices of submitting and allowing them to pass through or facing invasion.\n\nAlthough this could be seen as giving up our sovereignty and turning us into a Japanese puppet state, avoiding a war may be in our best interest."
 japan.12.a: "We will agree to an alliance with Japan."
 japan.12.b: "We will not surrender our independence so easily!"
 japan.13.t: "Siam Accepts Ultimatum"
 japan.13.d: "[From.GetLeader] has wisely decided to accept our ultimatum and forge a military alliance between our nations. Effectively, we will be able to use Siam as a base for future operations in the Pacific."
 japan.13.a: "The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere grows stronger."
 japan.14.t: "Siam Rejects Ultimatum"
 japan.14.d: "[From.GetLeader] has rejected our demands to enter Siam and our offer of a military alliance. Having announced our intent to enter regardless, this means war."

 wtt_japan.114.desc: "Democratic elements in the government have instigated a surprise take-over of the country, after the military threatened to once again curb the people's hard-gained democratic rights. With a surprising alacrity, a significant portion of the military has taken up arms in defense of the people and their rights to liberty.\n\nThis split in the military has allowed for the people's representatives to seize power in the legislative and executive branches. While the fighting has only just begun, it is unlikely that the present government can be unseated easily."

 poland.1.t: "Eastward Expansion"
 poland.1.d: "Having been forced to cede Gdansk to the Germans, we are now locked in a vise between two empires threatening our sovereignty. As we're losing territory in the west, not being able to trust the Allies to protect us from German aggression, we could consider aligning with the German ambitions and reclaim portions of our old Commonwealth now absorbed into [SOV.GetNameDef]. We will be easy prey if we remain neutral, and have fought too hard to see another partition of Poland."
 poland.1.a: "It's time to turn the Axis from a threat to an ally."
 poland.1.b: "Working diplomatically with the Soviet is preferable."
 poland.2.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands the East"
 poland.2.d: "Having reasserted their claims on our eastern territories, [FROM.GetNameDef] has now put pressure on us to cede this land to them, suggesting that this is the only way to avoid another invasion and possible annexation or partition.\n\nOrdinarily, giving in to such threats easily would be out of the question, but [FROM.GetNameDef] is far from our only concern. If we agree to their demands, we may have less to worry about on the eastern front, although it would also position the eastern front significantly further to the west."
 poland.2.a: "Give up the east peacefully."
 poland.2.b: "[ROOT.GetName] will not surrender without a fight!"
 poland.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Cedes the East"
 poland.3.d: "After we put pressure on [FROM.GetNameDef] to give in to our rightful claims on its eastern territories, they have agreed to cede what we demanded without further conflict. However, we can probably abandon any hopes of forming a stronger bond with the nation in the future. Having given us our due, they seem to hope we'll have as little contact as possible."
 poland.3.a: "As long as they recognize our claim, there is no problem."
 poland.4.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Cede the East"
 poland.4.d: "Despite our effort to resolve the dispute with [FROM.GetNameDef] peacefully, they have refused to cede their eastern territories and forced us into a position where the only option for claiming them is through war. Clearly, this troublesome country won't avoid a partition even when they are given the chance."
 poland.4.a: "Do they think they can stand against us?"
 poland.5.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers Protection"
 poland.5.d: "After [FROM.GetNameDef] claimed their right to eastern Poland, we assumed another attack as impending. However, a recent offer from the [FROM.GetAdjective]s indicate otherwise. Apparently, provided we cede the claimed territory, they are willing to let us join them in an alliance. Furthermore, they promise that in the event of a war with Germany, we will be compensated for the loss by being granted new land in the west.\n\nWhile this may be a better offer than we expected, we can't know if this supposed future war will ever be pursued. Perhaps [FROM.GetNameDef] is only looking for an easy land grab and forcing us into their sphere of influence. Nevertheless, it may be the best protection we can count on."
 poland.5.a: "We must accept now, before it's too late."
 poland.5.b: "[ROOT.GetName] Is Not Yet Lost!"
 poland.6.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Protection"
 poland.6.d: "Offering to take [FROM.GetNameDef] under our wing and guide them to future conquest in the west in exchange for territory in the east turned out to be a successful approach. Being promised a share of Germany in case of a successful war and our protection, they agreed to cede their eastern territories peacefully."
 poland.6.a: "An ally against Germany is much preferable to another partition."
 poland.7.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Protection"
 poland.7.d: "Despite making the most generous offer we possibly could, attempting an agreement where [FROM.GetNameDef] would cede its eastern territory for a promise of a future share of Germany, [From.GetLeader] has rejected our diplomatic efforts. [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has chosen the hard path, for us, but even more so for themselves."
 poland.7.a: "What cannot be bought must be seized."
 poland.8.t: "[POL.GetName] Granted Eastern Germany"
 poland.8.d: "As previously agreed upon, after the annexation of eastern Germany territories by [SOV.GetNameDef], some of these will be come under [POL.GetAdjective] control as recompense for the past transfer of eastern Poland to [SOV.GetNameDef]."

 poland.10.a: "[Root.GetName] and [From.GetName] today stands as brothers."
 poland.11.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses to Join [Root.GetFactionName]"
 poland.11.d: "In a foolish act of imagined self-preservation, [From.GetLeader] today announced that [From.GetName] will refrain from any diplomatic action that may be seen as threatening to their powerful neighbors. It has therefore declined our request that they join the [Root.GetFactionName]."
 poland.11.a: "The only safety is standing together."
 poland.12.t: "Wojtek Never Drops A Crate"
 poland.12.d: "Private Wojtek has proven himself a uniquely valuable member of our supply lines. Even during the heat of combat, small arms fire brushing the hair on his head, arms and legs, he did not drop a single crate of munitions. This brave soldier ensured our artillery could keep firing, and was thereby instrumental in defeating the enemy. As a result of this it has been decided that Wojtek should be promoted."
 poland.12.a: "May we all take inspiration from his bravery"
 WOJTEK_COMMANDER: "Wojtek becomes a §HCorps Commander§!"

 poland.1301.a: "Of course!"
 poland.1301.b: "We are not interested in this “[From.GetFactionName]”."
 poland.1302.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Denies [faction_invitee_target.GetAdjective] Entry"
 poland.1302.d: "It would appear that [From.GetLeader] does not have as much faith in the necessity of a [faction_invitee_target.GetAdjective] alliance as [Root.GetLeader] does. It is uncertain what the precise reasoning for this decision is, but clearly the [From.GetAdjective] government believes that [faction_invitee_target.GetNameDef] is more of a detriment than a boon to the continued survival of the [From.GetFactionName]."
 poland.1302.a: "Well, it was worth a try."

 poland.1303.d: "For whatever unknown reasons the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided that they would rather not join us in our fight for freedom on the side of the [From.From.GetFactionName]. Whatever their justification may be, the future does not look bright for continued [Root.GetAdjective]-[From.GetAdjective] cooperation."
 poland.1303.a: "Sad."
 poland.15.d.notlit: "A very worrying telegram arrived on the desk of [Root.GetLeader] today from the [From.GetAdjective] President, demanding that [Root.GetNameDef] lay down her arms and cede all territories to the [From.GetAdjective] state. [From.GetNameDefCap] has been attempting to restore the long-dead Commonwealth ever since [Root.GetNameDef]'s inception, and it seems that now they believe the mere threat of war between our nations will be enough to cause [Root.GetLeader] to crumble."
 poland.1501.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts!"
 poland.1501.d: "Today is a great day of celebration for [Root.GetNameDef] as the [From.GetAdjective] military has thrown down their arms and allowed [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers to march right into the capital and proclaim the reunification of [Root.GetNameDef] and [From.GetNameDef]! A Commonwealth reborn, the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] are filled with men and women waving [Root.GetAdjective] and [From.GetAdjective] flags in tandem, although such celebrations cannot be seen in the [From.GetAdjective] capital, where people seem to be strangely somber and mournful."
 poland.1501.a: "The Commonwealth is reborn!"
 poland.1502.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Defiant!"
 poland.1502.d: "A response has returned from [From.GetAdjective] high-command today outright refusing all [Root.GetAdjective] demands and claiming that they will “not allow [Root.GetLeader] to trample on [From.GetAdjective] sovereignty”. While many would rather not enter another state of war with [From.GetNameDef], if [Root.GetLeader] does not respond soon, future [Root.GetAdjective] demands are unlikely to be taken seriously."
 poland.1502.a: "[Root.GetNameDef] and [From.GetNameDef] will be one!"
 poland.20.desc.a: "An almost total lack of investment over the past four years has led to many declaring the Four Year Plan a total failure. Eastern Poland remains an insular region of impoverished farmers, the so-called 'central industrial region' is no more than a few pitiful factories and railway stations, and Polish industry is an embarrassment to the nation. Financial experts are certain that the utter failure of the Four Year Plan will be a lasting detriment to future Polish industrial efforts."
 poland.20.desc.b: "With modest investments, the Polish industrial sector's future looks bright, but is still leagues behind its neighbours in the West and East. Though it is not quite the massive industrial undertaking that [Root.GetLeader] promised, the investments made by the government will be of great benefit to the next Four Year Plan!"
 poland.20.desc.c: "The rasped shriek of a locomotive on rails, the acerb stench of soot and smog in the air, the incisive mist of industry stinging the eyes, these are the sensations of progress. To arrive in Poland's central region today is to arrive into a world of industry and progress. Factories, roads, rail, locomotives, automobiles, the Polish state has at last achieved them all. With Polands Congressional, Greater, and Eastern now linked with a tight network of road and rail, Poland is at last united as a single industrial entity and Kwiatkowski's Four Year Plan can at last be called a success. Although this does not spell the end for Polish industrial investments, the overwhelming success of the industrialization program has provided stability and employment to the people of Poland, and many feel ready for whatever future hardships the Polish state is to endure."

[GER.GetLeader] still seems to follow the advice of the Wehrmacht when it comes to military matters, blocking Himmler's attempts at creating and expanding an independent armed force as a counterweight.\n\nRumor has it that Himmler has instead turned his attention towards creating what he calls \"a new Order of Teutonic Knights for a new Germany\". These \"Knights\" swear fanatical loyalty and unquestioning obedience to Himmler personally and are each gifted a sword made to Himmler's design from steel blessed in old Germanic rituals - presumably to slay the enemies of the New Germany."

Clearly overtaken by his lust for power, the Reichsführer SS tried to kill [GER.GetLeader], but the gun jammed and didn't fire. In the moment of confusion, the Führer managed to overpower Himmler and shout for help. Reportedly, it took four members of his guard detail to restrain Himmler.\n\nElsewhere in the Reich, a number of tense standoffs between SS and regular Army units ensued as the former attempted to seize key communication posts but eventually withdrew after hearing that [GER.GetLeader] had survived.\n\nWehrmacht units have the main SS offices and holdings surrounded and are awaiting orders from Berlin."

Realizing that he must choose between his personal honor and the survival of the nation, Himmler decided to act immediately and shot him. In the aftermath, members of the Führer's guard detail attempted to kill Himmler as an assassin. Only the timely arrival of Himmler's own bodyguards saved the Reichsführer SS.\n\n Across Germany, the news of the death of the Führer has evidently served as a signal to put long-prepared into action. Both SS and regular Army units raced to secure bridges, telephone exchanges and crossroads, with Luftwaffe paratroopers rapidly mobilizing to seize airfields all across the Reich.\n\nGermany stands at the edge of a civil war, and all three factions will rely on the civilian government to actually run the country."
