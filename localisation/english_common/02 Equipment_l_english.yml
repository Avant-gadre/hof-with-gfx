 ALB_infantry_equipment_3_short: "MKar M.44"
 ALB_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The development of a portable automatic rifle using an intermediate cartridge was born in the Monarchy thanks to the success of the Király series of "heavy" submachine guns and the realisation that combat ranges were far shorter than anticipated. Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

 ALB_mechanized_equipment_1_short: "TPz M.38/40"
 ALB_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "The need for an armoured transport for mechanised infantry led to the conversion of several different vehicles to fill the role. The Saurer R77 artillery tractor was one of the first of such conversions and was relatively simple: An armoured \"box\" was added to the chasis that protected the driver and personnel inside. The deployment of these conversions helped cement the concept of armoured transports in Austrian doctrine."
 ALB_mechanized_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd Transportpanzer M.39/42"
 ALB_mechanized_equipment_2_short: "TPz M.39/42"
 ALB_mechanized_equipment_2_desc: "In 1942, the Hungarian company Weiss Manfréd began to convert the obsolete Nimród SPAT/SPAA vehicles into APCs and armoured ambulances nicknamed Lehel by the Hungarians. They proved to be superior to the TPz38/40 in every way with stronger armour and a better engine."
 ALB_mechanized_equipment_3: "Škoda-MÁVAG Transportpanzer M.40/44"
 ALB_mechanized_equipment_3_short: "TPz M.40/44"
 ALB_mechanized_equipment_3_desc: "When Austria phased out the M.40 tank for the M.42, the former were converted. One of those conversions were an APC similar to the Lehel, with the turret removed and hull interior rearranged to accommodate a squad of Panzerinfanterie."

 ALB_armored_car_equipment_2_short: "PzA M.42"
 ALB_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "Changes on the battlefield required a much heavier armament for reconnaissance vehicles. To provide a quick solution, it was decided to adopt the brand new turret from the SpPz M.42 and equip it with lighter 40mm Bofors gun."
 ALB_armored_car_at_equipment: "PanzerjägerAutomobil "Attila" M.43"
 ALB_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "As the army's light mechanised units were coming into contact with enemy tank forces, it was decided to equip some M.42 models with a 57mm gun turret from the SpPZ M.42 and specialised AT ammunition."

### Land ###
 AMA_infantry_equipment_0: "Espingarda Mauser Modelo 1908"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser M08"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Grão Pará state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."
 AMA_infantry_equipment_1: "Fusil Mauser Modelo 1935"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser M35"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilises a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the German model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."
 AMA_infantry_equipment_2: "Submetralhadora Bergmann Modelo 1938"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Bergmann M38"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 AMA_infantry_equipment_3: "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest German semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."
 AMA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Rossi M44"
 AMA_support_weapons: "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 AMA_support_weapons_1: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 AMA_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_2_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstacles and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 AMA_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_3_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."
 AMA_infantry_at: "Metralhadora Anti-Tanque Imbel .50"
 AMA_infantry_at_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."
 AMA_infantry_at2: "Lança Rojão M44"
 AMA_infantry_at2_desc: "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."

 AMA_artillery_equipment_1: "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 AMA_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 AMA_artillery_equipment_2: "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 AMA_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 AMA_artillery_equipment_3: "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 AMA_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Northern A until the 1960s."
 AMA_artillery_equipment_1_short: "Ob. Rm. de 10,5 cm"
 AMA_artillery_equipment_2_short: "Ob. M41 de 11,5cm"

 AMA_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "CAA M5 de 3,7cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "CAA M7 de 8,8cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_1: "Canhão Antiaéreo M2 de 2cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_2: "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_3: "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "CAT Alemão de 3,7 cm"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "CAT de 7,5 cm"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "CAT M6 de 12,8 cm"
 AMA_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 32cm"
 AMA_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Following the specifications of the original models, rockets of 32cm were used in these weapons, and a lack of said rockets is exactly why they were seldom used."
 AMA_rocket_artillery_equipment_2: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 21cm"
 AMA_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Changes to the size of the rockets required for usage made later models more common, but still far from standard issue and few pieces of the LF de 21cm were used in the field when compared to even the M43."

 ANG_infantry_equipment_0: "Espingarda 6,5 mm m/1904"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser-Vergueiro"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "A bolt action rifle with a long history of service, the 6,5 mm m/1904 is more commonly known by the moniker of 'Mauser-Vergueiro', as the main design of the gun is essentially that of the Mauser 98 (with a special bolt action mechanism heavily based on the Gewehr 1888) with the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro cartridge, one developed specifically for the portuguese variant. It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."
 ANG_infantry_equipment_1: "Espingarda 7.92 mm m/1904/36"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser-Vergueiro M36"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Fundamentally little more than an updated version of the Mauser-Vergueiro, it was introduced to Africa amid rising tensions between Portugal and Germany. A significant amount of these weapons later found themselves under use by the forces of the states in former Portuguese Africa."
 ANG_infantry_equipment_2: "Carabina C.A.P Modelo 01"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_2_short: "C.A.P M40"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "A prototype carbine that saw little widespread use in Portugal's army as a whole was the country's first attempt at a standard issue, nationally produced design. As such, the nationalist Integralist junta supported the development of the C.A.P carbine intensely, but by the time it was ready for production, realities on the ground made it more worthwhile to switch to the FBP overall directly from the older Mauser-Vergueiro and variants already widely in use by the armed forces."
 ANG_infantry_equipment_3: "Pistola-Metralhadora FBP M/945"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_3_short: "FBP M/945"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The FBP submachine gun is named after the acronym for the Braço de Prata Factory, the manufacturer for the weapon, a foundry owned and controlled by the Portuguese government itself. While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg. While few of the models made it overseas when compared to the old Mauser-Vergueiro, the government of Angola was capable of starting production domestically relatively swiftly after decolonisation."
 ANG_support_weapons: "Metralhadora Vickers & Morteiro Stokes"
 ANG_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the British Empire during the Weltkrieg. During its rearmament after the conflict, the restored Portuguese monarchy purchased and fabricated them with the intention of widespread use among infantry both at home and overseas."
 ANG_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora Lewis Modelo DEMS & Morteiro SBML de 2 Polegadas"
 ANG_support_weapons_2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis served the Entente since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. The MKIII variant had a pistol grip that allowed it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML, while small, is incredibly portable and had greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 ANG_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Vickers Modelo II & Morteiro ML de 3 Polegadas"
 ANG_support_weapons_3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG featured a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It had been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar was a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it was reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 ANG_support_weapons4: "Metralhadora Vickers-Vedras & Morteiro de 4.2 Polegadas"
 ANG_support_weapons_4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar was a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 ANG_infantry_at: "Morteiro-Bombarda"
 ANG_infantry_at_desc: "Developed in Canada and sold in substantial amounts to Portugal, the mortar design was that of a 'spigot' mortar. Arguing that the design could serve as both an artillery piece and an anti-tank weapon, the design was eagerly adopted by several allies of the Entente, including Portugal. Many ended up stranded in its former overseas possessions."
 ANG_infantry_at2: "LATI"
 ANG_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the LATI (A direct translation of its Canadian English name) was developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device was well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there were concerns about its intense recoil."

 ANQ_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Originally a product of late Guangxu era 'Self Strengthening' efforts, the Type 88 was designed as a copy of the German Gewehr 88 with export modifications. While collectively inferior to newer rifles despite improvements, and often poorly maintained, the weapon is known to be rugged and reliable if unwieldy.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Hanyang Arsenal, the model's place of design, though equipment shortages often see it used alongside non-standard weapons."

 ANQ_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Officially called the 'Xuantong Type 27', this rifle was put into service in 1935 thanks to German assistance after the Qing Restoration. The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Hanyang Arsenal with German tools, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."

 ANQ_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Type 35 is a semi-automatic rifle based on the General Liu rifle from 1914. While appearing similar, the Type 35 is shorter, has the rear of the receiver covered, and the gas-trap system replaced by a simple gas port. The new rifle is also no longer able to switch to manual action and uses magazines from the Bohemian ZH-29 rifle and ZB-26 light machine gun."

 BAH_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser M08"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Bahia state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."
 BAH_infantry_equipment_1: "Fusil Mauser Modelo 1935"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser M35"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilises a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the German model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."
 BAH_infantry_equipment_2: "Submetralhadora Bergmann Modelo 1938"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Bergmann M38"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 BAH_infantry_equipment_3: "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest German semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."
 BAH_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Rossi M44"
 BAH_support_weapons: "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 BAH_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 BAH_support_weapons_1: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 BAH_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 BAH_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 BAH_support_weapons_2_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstacles and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 BAH_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 BAH_support_weapons_3_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."
 BAH_infantry_at: "Metralhadora Anti-Tanque Imbel .50"
 BAH_infantry_at_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."
 BAH_infantry_at2: "Lança Rojão M44"
 BAH_infantry_at2_desc: "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."

 BAH_artillery_equipment_1: "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 BAH_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 BAH_artillery_equipment_2: "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 BAH_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 BAH_artillery_equipment_3: "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 BAH_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Bahian army until the 1960s."

 BAH_anti_air_equipment_1: "Canhão Antiaéreo M2 de 2cm"
 BAH_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 BAH_anti_air_equipment_2: "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 BAH_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 BAH_anti_air_equipment_3: "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 BAH_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 BAH_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 32cm"
 BAH_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Following the specifications of the original models, rockets of 32cm were used in these weapons, and a lack of said rockets is exactly why they were seldom used."
 BAH_rocket_artillery_equipment_2: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 21cm"
 BAH_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Changes to the size of the rockets required for usage made later models more common, but still far from standard issue and few pieces of the LF de 21cm were used in the field when compared to even the M43."

 BAY_mechanized_equipment_3_desc: "In late 1943, the German Army asked Auto-Union to develop a light, fully tracked reconnaissance vehicle, capable of carrying 6-8 men in an open-top superstructure. Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

 BAY_gw_armored_car_equipment_dsec: "Introduced in 1936, the Leichter Panzerspähwagen ('light armoured reconnaissance vehicle') Sd. Kfz. 222 is a modernised version of the Sd. Kfz. 221. Being a road armoured car, manned by a three-man crew and has 4-wheel drive, the Sd.Kfz. 222 armed with a 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon and a 7,92-mm M.G. 13 machine gun. Performing well on the good road network, the reconnaissance vehicle suffered in performance on the rough terrain and was badly received by colonial troops."

 BAY_armored_car_equipment_1_desc: "The Sd.Kfz. 231 Schwerer Panzerspähwagen ('heavy armoured reconnaissance vehicle') is a military designation for a line of reconnaissance armoured cars intended for armoured divisions. Initially developed in 1932 as 6 wheels variants, it was obvious that this variant will be obsolete in the nearest future. In 1937 the 8 wheels variant armed with 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon was introduced in service. The all-wheel drive four-axle Sd.Kfz. 231 are one of the most technically advanced armoured vehicles and are able to operate on rough terrain, with a cross-country comparable to that of tanks."

 BAY_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "This new armoured car is seen as a successor to the eight-wheeled Panzerspähwagen Sd.Kfz.231. Among other priorities, better protection and heavier armament were viewed as crucial for the new armoured car. The production vehicle is heavier and bulkier than the Sd.Kfz.231, with mudguards that went along the side from end to end, with four storage compartments located inside. The main version of the vehicle, also known as Sd.Kfz.234/1, is armed with open-top turret fitted with a 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon and coaxial M.G. 34."

 BAY_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "A respectable armoured car, the Sd.Kfz.234/2 (also known as 'Puma') presents great speed and a significant 50 mm KwK.39/1 cannon. With improved frontal armour and formidable main gun, the car can traverse into volatile areas that are generally restricted to other like-minded vehicles. Being the greatly improved variant of the Sd.Kfz.234, the 'Puma' is intended to be used in a 6-strong platoon as a support vehicle. More often, though, commanders use the Sd.Kfz. 234/2 as fast tank hunters."

 BAY_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 BAY_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 BAY_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 BAY_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 BAY_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 BAY_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 BAY_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 BAY_anti_air_equipment_1: "2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 BAY_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 BAY_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 BAY_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 BAY_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 BAY_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 BAY_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 BAY_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 BAY_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

 BAY_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed for Nebeltruppen (Smoke Troops) for smokescreen setting, the schwere Wurfgerät 40 exists in two variants - with wooden and steel frames. The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."

 BAY_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

 BOS_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Karabin Model 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."

 BOS_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

 WIF_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 WIF_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 WIF_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 WIF_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 WIF_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 WIF_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 WIF_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 WIF_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming."
 WIF_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 WIF_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 WIF_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 WIF_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 WIF_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 WIF_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 WIF_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 WIF_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 WIF_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 WIF_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 WIF_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 WIF_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 WIF_night_vision: "Tabby Scope"
 WIF_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 WIF_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 WIF_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 WIF_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 WIF_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 WIF_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 WIF_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."

 CRO_infantry_equipment_0: "Karabin Model 1895/30"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mannlicher M.95/30"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Karabin Model 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 CRO_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabin Model 1935"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG M.35"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."
 CRO_infantry_equipment_2: "Kratka strojnica Model 1939"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Danuvia M.39"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."
 CRO_infantry_equipment_3: "Strojokarabin Model 1942"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zbrojovka Brno M.42"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."
 CRO_infantry_weapons2: "Kratka strojnica Model 1934"
 CRO_infantry_weapons2_short: "Steyr-Solothurn M.34"
 CRO_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While a German design by Louis Stange, the  MP 34 was mainly produced by Steyr and was adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army. As common with early submachine guns, this design was heavy, expensive, but reliable, with a horizontal magazine using the potent 9x25mm Mauser cartridge."

Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

 PRE_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "The Sonderkraftfahrzeug 11 was developed from 1934 to 1938 and involved Borgward AG and, from 1937 onwards, the design became associated with Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG. Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent. Capable of carrying eight soldiers in addition to towing a gun or a trailer, the truck became the main vehicle of panzergrenadiers."

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

Initially developed in 1932 as 6 wheels variants, it was obvious that this variant will be obsolete in the nearest future. In 1937 the 8 wheels variant armed with 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon was introduced in service. The all-wheel drive four-axle Sd.Kfz. 231 are one of the most technically advanced armoured vehicles and are able to operate on rough terrain, with a cross-country comparable to that of tanks."

Among other priorities, better protection and heavier armament were viewed as crucial for the new armoured car. The production vehicle is heavier and bulkier than the Sd.Kfz.231, with mudguards that went along the side from end to end, with four storage compartments located inside. The main version of the vehicle, also known as Sd.Kfz.234/1, is armed with open-top turret fitted with a 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon and coaxial M.G. 34."

With improved frontal armour and formidable main gun, the car can traverse into volatile areas that are generally restricted to other like-minded vehicles. Being the greatly improved variant of the Sd.Kfz.234, the 'Puma' is intended to be used in a 6-strong platoon as a support vehicle. More often, though, commanders use the Sd.Kfz. 234/2 as fast tank hunters."

 PRE_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 PRE_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 PRE_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 PRE_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 PRE_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 PRE_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 PRE_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 PRE_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 PRE_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 PRE_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 PRE_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 PRE_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 PRE_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 PRE_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 PRE_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 PRE_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 PRE_anti_air_equipment_1: "2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 PRE_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 PRE_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 PRE_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 PRE_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 PRE_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 PRE_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 PRE_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 PRE_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."

 PRE_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

 FOP_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "In response to an aggressive Argentinian armament programme, Chile adopted a modified Mauser 1893 (commonly known as the Spanish Mauser) chambered in 7x57mm Mauser, and contracted the German company DWM (Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken) for more than 100,000 rifles and carbines on the pattern. The Chilean Mauser 1895 has earned a reputation for reliability under even the harshest conditions, one which it maintains decades after its adoption. It mainly with these Chilean Mausers that the revolutionary government in Patagonia is equipped."

Many of these carbines eventually fell into the hands of the Chilean Carabinieros, who found the rifle unsatisfactory and lobbied for its replacement. In 1935, a new pattern with improved ergonomics and a new larger magazine with more robust feed lips and loader was approved and entered into production shortly thereafter. A few months after its initial production, the rifles began to trickle into Patagonia."

 GAL_infantry_equipment_0: "Karabinek wzór 1895/30"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mannlicher wz. 95/30"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Karabinek wzór 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 GAL_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabinek wzór 1935"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG wz. 35"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."
 GAL_infantry_equipment_2: "Pistolet maszynowy wzór 1939"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Danuvia wz. 39"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."
 GAL_infantry_equipment_3: "Karabinek maszynowy wzór 1942"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zbrojovka Brno wz. 42"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."
 GAL_infantry_weapons2: "Pistolet maszynowy wzór 1934"
 GAL_infantry_weapons2_short: "Steyr-Solothurn wz. 34"
 GAL_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While a German design by Louis Stange, the  MP 34 was mainly produced by Steyr and was adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army. As common with early submachine guns, this design was heavy, expensive, but reliable, with a horizontal magazine using the potent 9x25mm Mauser cartridge."
 GAL_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Pistolet maszynowy wzór 38"
 GAL_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "Zbrojovka Brno wz. 38"
 GAL_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Seeing the need for a submachine-gun using the standard pistol cartridge of the Army, the Monarchy would adopt the ZK 383, designed by brothers Josef and František Koucký at Zbrojovka Brno, as the MP 38. Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."
 GAL_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Pistolet maszynowy wzór 1943"
 GAL_advanced_infantry_weapons2_short: "Danuvia wz. 43"
 GAL_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While the Danuvia 39M proved successful, its folding magazine was not enough to compensate for its bulky design for vehicle crewmen. The 43M redesign with a folding metal stock and a new, more reliable foldable magazine design allowed it to be much more compact during transport or storage, without sacrificing firepower."

 GBP_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the revolution and civil war it became apparent that the No.3 Enfield was not fit for urban combat. Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

#GBR_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Long, Ross Mk III"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Ross Mk III"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."
 GBR_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk V"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the loyal Dominions only had access to one arsenal capable of producing its service rifle. Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 GBR_infantry_equipment_2: "Carbine, Machine, Owen Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Gun"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 GBR_infantry_equipment_3: "Rifle, Self-Loading, Long Branch Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 GBR_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 GBR_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 GBR_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 GBR_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 GBR_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 GBR_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 GBR_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 GBR_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 GBR_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 GBR_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 GBR_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 GBR_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 GBR_night_vision: "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 GBR_night_vision_short: "Tabby Scope"
 GBR_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 GBR_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Machine, Thompson Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States."
 GBR_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Carbine, Machine, Lanchester Mk I"
 GBR_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 GBR_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Commando, De Lisle Mk I"
 GBR_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "What began as a private venture by engineer William Godfray de Lisle soon caught the attention of the RCMP's Special Branch looking to equip agents with improved weaponry. The De Lisle carbine is, essentially, a shortened SMLE converted to .45 ACP, a subsonic cartridge with an integrated suppressor. The suppressor and ammunition together produced as little as 85.5 decibels when firing, making it very suitable for commando operations."

Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent. Capable of carrying eight soldiers in addition to towing a gun or a trailer, the truck became the main vehicle of panzergrenadiers."

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour.

 GRP_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser M08"
 GRP_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Guararapes state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."
 GRP_infantry_equipment_1: "Fusil Mauser Modelo 1935"
 GRP_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser M35"
 GRP_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilises a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the German model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."

 GRP_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Bergmann M38"
 GRP_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 GRP_infantry_equipment_3: "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 GRP_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest German semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."
 GRP_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Rossi M44"
 GRP_support_weapons: "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 GRP_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 GRP_support_weapons_1: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 GRP_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 GRP_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 GRP_support_weapons_2_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstacles and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 GRP_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 GRP_support_weapons_3_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."
 GRP_infantry_at: "Metralhadora Anti-Tanque Imbel .50"
 GRP_infantry_at_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."
 GRP_infantry_at2: "Lança Rojão M44"
 GRP_infantry_at2_desc: "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."

 GRP_artillery_equipment_1: "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 GRP_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 GRP_artillery_equipment_2: "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 GRP_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 GRP_artillery_equipment_3: "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 GRP_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Northeastern Armies until the 1960s."

 GRP_anti_air_equipment_1: "Canhão Antiaéreo M2 de 2cm"
 GRP_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 GRP_anti_air_equipment_2: "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 GRP_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 GRP_anti_air_equipment_3: "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 GRP_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 GRP_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 32cm"
 GRP_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Following the specifications of the original models, rockets of 32cm were used in these weapons, and a lack of said rockets is exactly why they were seldom used."
 GRP_rocket_artillery_equipment_2: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 21cm"
 GRP_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Changes to the size of the rockets required for usage made later models more common, but still far from standard issue and few pieces of the LF de 21cm were used in the field when compared to even the M43."

Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent.

 GRU_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 GRU_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 GRU_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 GRU_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 GRU_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 GRU_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 GRU_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 GRU_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."

The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

 GYA_infantry_equipment_0_short: "SMLE Mk III"
 GYA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 GYA_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 GYA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 GYA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 GYA_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 GYA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 GYA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 GYA_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 GYA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 GYA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming."
 GYA_night_vision: "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 GYA_night_vision_short: "Tabby Scope"
 GYA_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 GYA_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 GYA_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 GYA_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 GYA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 GYA_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 GYA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 GYA_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 GYA_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 GYA_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 GYA_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 GYA_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 GYA_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 GYA_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 GYA_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 GYA_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 GYA_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 GYA_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 GYA_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 GYA_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

 HUN_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Danuvia 39.M"
 HUN_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."

 HUN_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zbrojovka Brno 42.M"
 HUN_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."

 HUN_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While a German design by Louis Stange, the  MP 34 was mainly produced by Steyr and was adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army. As common with early submachine guns, this design was heavy, expensive, but reliable, with a horizontal magazine using the potent 9x25mm Mauser cartridge."

 HUN_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "Zbrojovka Brno 38.M"
 HUN_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Seeing the need for a submachine-gun using the standard pistol cartridge of the Army, the Monarchy would adopt the ZK 383, designed by brothers Josef and František Koucký at Zbrojovka Brno, as the MP 38. Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

 HUN_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While the Danuvia 39M proved successful, its folding magazine was not enough to compensate for its bulky design for vehicle crewmen. The 43M redesign with a folding metal stock and a new, more reliable foldable magazine design allowed it to be much more compact during transport or storage, without sacrificing firepower."

 GOY_infantry_equipment_0: "Espingarda Mauser Modelo 1908"
 GOY_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser M08"
 GOY_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Goyaz state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."
 GOY_infantry_equipment_1: "Fusil Mauser Modelo 1935"
 GOY_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser M35"
 GOY_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilises a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the German model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."
 GOY_infantry_equipment_2: "Submetralhadora Bergmann Modelo 1938"
 GOY_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Bergmann M38"
 GOY_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 GOY_infantry_equipment_3: "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 GOY_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest German semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."
 GOY_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Rossi M44"
 GOY_support_weapons: "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 GOY_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 GOY_support_weapons_1: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 GOY_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 GOY_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 GOY_support_weapons_2_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstacles and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 GOY_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 GOY_support_weapons_3_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."

When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."
 GOY_infantry_at2: "Lança Rojão M44"
 GOY_infantry_at2_desc: "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."

 GOY_artillery_equipment_1: "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 GOY_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 GOY_artillery_equipment_2: "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 GOY_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 GOY_artillery_equipment_3: "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 GOY_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Goiano army until the 1960s."

 GOY_anti_air_equipment_1: "Canhão Antiaéreo M2 de 2cm"
 GOY_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 GOY_anti_air_equipment_2: "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 GOY_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 GOY_anti_air_equipment_3: "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 GOY_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 GOY_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 32cm"
 GOY_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Following the specifications of the original models, rockets of 32cm were used in these weapons, and a lack of said rockets is exactly why they were seldom used."

 GOY_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Changes to the size of the rockets required for usage made later models more common, but still far from standard issue and few pieces of the LF de 21cm were used in the field when compared to even the M43."

 JAM_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk III"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_0_short: "SMLE Mk III"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 JAM_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 JAM_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 JAM_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming."
 JAM_night_vision: "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 JAM_night_vision_short: "Tabby Scope"
 JAM_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 JAM_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 JAM_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 JAM_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 JAM_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 JAM_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 JAM_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 JAM_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 JAM_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 JAM_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 JAM_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 JAM_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 JAM_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 JAM_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 JAM_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 JAM_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 JAM_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 JAM_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 JAM_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 JAM_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

 JAM_armored_car_equipment_2_short: "Rhino"
 JAM_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "With the success of the Rover under its belt, the Ruskin Motor Bodies company designed the Rhino in response to an Australasian government request for a substantially heavier armoured car built upon the CMP chassis. Though substantial changes were made to that CMP chassis, after much work the Rhino was born, and with substantial interchangeability of parts with other CMP-based designs to boot."
 JAM_armored_car_at_equipment: "Ruskin Hippo"
 JAM_armored_car_at_equipment_short: "Hippo"
 JAM_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "To accommodate a substantially larger gun, the Rhino's coaxial machine had to be removed and its turret slightly enlarged. The 'Hippo' as this model has been designated, proved to be quite the headache for its design team, as these changes caused the already heavy vehicle to run into weight issues like its predecessors which had to be slowly worked out prior to the vehicle's adoption."

 LEC_infantry_equipment_0_short: "No.1 Mk III*"
 LEC_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Alongside the German Mauser, the Lee-Enfield is perhaps one of the most recognisable rifles in service with any military. Although the No.1 Mk III* saw use in the Legation Cities well before the Weltkrieg in the hands of the old British garrison, the revolution in 1926 and the retreat of the China Station to Australasia in the same year saw the rifle continue service with police forces across the Legation Cities, as well as with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.\n\nAs most of these rifles were Weltkrieg-era surplus, and many have long been without proper maintenance or replaceable parts, attrition has taken its toll. Now that there may be too few rifles to furnish an expanded police force, some have come to regard the Lee-Enfield as necessarily obsolete."

 LEC_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser 98b"
 LEC_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser 98b is the cutting edge of German bolt-action rifle technology. With an easier to operate bolt, superior ironsights, an improved stock, and a lighter build, this weapon is a substantial improvement over its predecessors. The 98b is also especially practical in China, as the most common rifle beyond the Neutral Zone is the Hanyang 88, a copy of the older Mauser 1888, with which it shares ammunition."

 LEC_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by the Mauser company in response to a German Army desire for a self-loading rifle with a backup bolt action, the Selbstladegewehr 40 was a massive leap forward in German small arms design. While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the German army eventually dropped some its other specific requirements for the rifle, and the end result, the predecessor the rifle that would ultimately be adopted, proved effective."

While the first prototype of the rifle was prone to jamming, both the military and even the Kaiser himself were extremely enthusiastic about the project and immense resources were concentrated on improving the design, with the rifle deemed ready for adoption in 1942."

The top of the carriage is equipped with a machine gun or infantry support gun, with several shooting holes at the rear. The compartment of the armoured vehicle has skylights, allowing the crews to reach out of the compartment, in order to suppress a crowd with strong light or high-pressure water guns. The huge carriage of the armoured vehicle made it look like a prison vehicle, so people gave this unnamed riot control vehicle a derogatory nickname: 'Feixing Baolei' or 'Flying Fortress'.

Liberia acquired its Krags as highly discounted military assistance from the United States shortly after the fall of France in Europe, thanks largely to American fears of Nationalist French invasion of the country."

This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 MAF_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 MAF_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 MAF_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 MAF_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 MAF_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 MAF_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 MAF_anti_air_equipment_1: "2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."

 MAF_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

 MZB_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "A bolt action rifle with a long history of service, the 6,5 mm m/1904 is more commonly known by the moniker of 'Mauser-Vergueiro', as the main design of the gun is essentially that of the Mauser 98 (with a special bolt action mechanism heavily based on the Gewehr 1888) with the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro cartridge, one developed specifically for the portuguese variant. It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."

 MZB_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "A prototype carbine that saw little widespread use in Portugal's army as a whole was the country's first attempt at a standard issue, nationally produced design. As such, the nationalist Integralist junta supported the development of the C.A.P carbine intensely, but by the time it was ready for production, realities on the ground made it more worthwhile to switch to the FBP overall directly from the older Mauser-Vergueiro and variants already widely in use by the armed forces."
 MZB_infantry_equipment_3: "Pistola-Metralhadora FBP M/945"

 MZB_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The FBP submachine gun is named after the acronym for the Braço de Prata Factory, the manufacturer for the weapon, a foundry owned and controlled by the Portuguese government itself. While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg. While few of the models made it overseas when compared to the old Mauser-Vergueiro, the government of Mozambique was capable of starting production domestically relatively swiftly after decolonisation."

 MZB_support_weapons_2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis served the Entente since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. The MKIII variant had a pistol grip that allowed it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML, while small, is incredibly portable and had greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 MZB_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Vickers Modelo II & Morteiro ML de 3 Polegadas"
 MZB_support_weapons_3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG featured a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It had been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar was a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it was reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 MZB_support_weapons4: "Metralhadora Vickers-Vedras & Morteiro de 4.2 Polegadas"
 MZB_support_weapons_4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar was a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 MZB_infantry_at: "Morteiro-Bombarda"
 MZB_infantry_at_desc: "Developed in Canada and sold in substantial amounts to Portugal, the mortar design was that of a 'spigot' mortar. Arguing that the design could serve as both an artillery piece and an anti-tank weapon, the design was eagerly adopted by several allies of the Entente, including Portugal. Many ended up stranded in its former overseas possessions."
 MZB_infantry_at2: "LATI"
 MZB_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the LATI (A direct translation of its Canadian English name) was developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device was well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there were concerns about its intense recoil."

 NEE_infantry_equipment_0_short: "M1903 Springfield"
 NEE_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Model 1903 was developed at Springfield Arsenal when, following the Spanish-American war, the United States deemed the Krag-Jørgensen rifle inadequate on account of its weak action; at its core, the 1903 was an attempt to combine beneficial features of both the Krag and captureds Spanish Mausers. Beginning just before the Weltkrieg, the rifle was gradually adopted along with the .30-06 cartridge, a process that would take several years."

 NEE_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "The M1 Garand comes from French-Canadian John Garand at the Springfield Armory. The .30 calibre, gas-operated, 8 shot clip-fed, semi-automatic rifle is designed for simple assemblage and can be field stripped without tools in a few seconds. The semi-automatic operation gives the American rifleman a significant advantage in firepower and shot-to-shot recovery times over enemies armed with bolt action rifles."

The M18 was developed in response to rapid improvements in armour which greatly diminished the effectiveness of anti-tank rifles small enough to be man-portable. The M18 Recoilless Rifle has an effective range of 400 yards, a maximum range of nearly 5,000 yards, and is more accurate compared with the old M2. It quickly was nicknamed 'pocket artillery' by the soldiers who used it."

 NEE_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States. As part of New England's ties to the Entente, the classic American submachine gun was among some of the weapons sent to the new Provisional Government."

As the Civil War raged across America, Reising turned his attention towards developing a submachine gun. A rival to the 1928A1, the M50 is considerably cheaper to produce and features a closed bolt system that gives it more accuracy in semi-automatic fire."

Developed by Harvey Earle, the M-25 features a reworked gas system along with component parts designed to be fabricated with general tools and machines. The rifle also fires 0.30 ammunition and is incredibly light, a mere 7 pounds. Initial testings have been favourable with many praising the M-25's accuracy over the M1 Garand's."

This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

 NGF_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800-2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

 NGF_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_short: "s.W.G. 40"
 NGF_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed for Nebeltruppen (Smoke Troops) for smokescreen setting, the schwere Wurfgerät 40 exists in two variants - with wooden and steel frames. The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."

 NGF_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_short: "R.W. 42"
 NGF_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

 NZL_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk III"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_0_short: "SMLE Mk III"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming."
 NZL_night_vision: "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 NZL_night_vision_short: "Tabby Scope"
 NZL_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 NZL_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 NZL_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 NZL_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 NZL_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 NZL_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 NZL_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 NZL_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 NZL_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 NZL_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 NZL_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 NZL_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 NZL_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 NZL_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 NZL_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 NZL_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

Built to haul heavy trains on the mountainous lines of the Northern Appennine, while keeping a comparatively low axle load of 14 tons to run on older, less frequently mantained tracks, these engines excelled in their task, and were subsequently built in copious number before the Great War. Distributed across the Peninsula to relieve the older pre-nationalisation engines, a good number of those engines ended up in service around Rome, and subsequently remained in our hands."

Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the German model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority.

 VCR_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

Unfortunately, due to Shanxi's narrow roads and mountainous terrain, and the technical blockade imposed by the Qing government on Shanxi, it was difficult for Yan Xishan to buy trucks directly from the Japanese. Therefore, in March 1932, he ordered the engineer Jiang Shouting to go to Tianjin to negotiate with the representatives from the American Federal Motor Truck Company. The Americans eventually agreed to transfer the 1.5 ton truck technology to Shanxi, and Jiang Shouting used this as a basis to create the reliable and durable Type Shanxi by the end of the same year."

 SIC_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. As part of Sicilian-German cooperation in response to the red threat of the north, large quantities of the 98b were shipped to Sicily."

The Two Sicilies tested the rifle and like the Austrians, found the rifle unreliable in harsh conditions and difficult to disassemble, but sought to redesign the gun to fix its shortcomings. The SME state run electrical company, which had begun to produce and design small arms only a few years prior, was set to the task. The end result, designated the SME M38 upon adoption, while improved over its Czech predecessor, still bears many of the latter's design quirks."

While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the German Heer eventually dropped some of its other specific requirements for the rifle. The end result was the initial prototype with only a few design edits, and it proved effective. As a response to growing tensions on the Italian peninsula, large numbers of these rifles were sent to the Sicilian Armed Forces."

Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

Starting in 1933, the Ottoman Empire updated their old rifles to a common configuration known in the Empire as the Model of 1936 and all in 8x57 Mauser cartridge. Many of these weapons were sold to Somalia, as the state had a difficult time establishing a local manufacturing plant for weapons.

 SPO_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Bergmann M38"
 SPO_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 SPO_infantry_equipment_3: "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 SPO_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest German semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."

 SPO_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 SPO_support_weapons_1: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 SPO_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 SPO_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 SPO_support_weapons_2_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstacles and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 SPO_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 SPO_support_weapons_3_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."

When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."

 SPO_infantry_at2_desc: "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."

 SPO_artillery_equipment_1: "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 SPO_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 SPO_artillery_equipment_2: "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 SPO_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 SPO_artillery_equipment_3: "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 SPO_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Gaucho army until the 1960s."

 SPO_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

 SPO_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."

 SPO_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

The Carabina is an ambitiously-engineered and well-built submachine gun submitted by Hotchkiss in 1938 as the Type 017, which entered service as the Carabine-Mitrailleuses Hotchkiss Type M2 (along with its police variant Type M1). The CMH2's extreme compactness is both its best and worst feature - the complexity of having every protruding part fold or retract make the weapon expensive to produce and also reduces ergonomics, which isn't ideal for quick target acquisition."

The Fusil MAT Modèle 43 is an automatic rifle, using a 7.5x54mm cartridge and a foldable magazine, which allows it to be a little more compact than its regular counterparts. Along with this, the MAT-43 is produced by machine-stamping process which allows the economical production of large numbers of rifles, then urgently required by the Sardinian Government. Despite some issues with rate of fire and reliability, the MAS-43 is considered as the next step in personal weapons."

 SRD_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "By the early 1920s, the French Army had come to the realisation that the armour-piercing capability of the 37mm TRP infantry gun would be insufficient against modern tanks. In 1926 Hotchkiss proposed a 25mm gun design, which was not immediately adopted due to financial issues, and the availability of the Matériel de 75mm. The Matériel de 25mm, which entered service only in 1936 with the realisation of the approaching battle for France, is a reliable weapon inspired by the Filloux concept."

 SRD_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "After the retreat to Algeria, the French military announced the need for a specialised anti-aircraft autocannon. Hotchkiss introduced the 25 mm project in 1936, which was adopted due to the slow development of a more promising Schneider variant. Despite the acceptance of the Mitrailleuse 25mm CA into service, the original tripod was replaced to a triangular base with a two-wheel carriage as per the army's request."

The Matériel de 75mm Contre-Aérien Modèle 1940 by Schneider has faster rate of fire, higher muzzle velocity, increased vertical range, modern fire control and greater mobility with new gun carriages, than the old Soixante-Quinze. Impressed by the performance of the former Mitrailleuse 37mm CA from Schneider, the French command quickly adopted the new 75mm gun."

Built to haul heavy trains on the mountainous lines of the Northern Appennine, while keeping a comparatively low axle load of 14 tons to run on older, less frequently mantained tracks, these engines excelled in their task, and were subsequently built in copious number before the Great War. Distributed across the Peninsula to relieve the older pre-nationalisation engines, a good number of those engines ended up hauling trains on the Sardinian Dorsal Railway, and subsequently remained in our hands."

The weapon got its name from the Telegraphic Code of Company, Armaguerra. A weapon with important accuracy and reliability, the Armaguerra will help bring the revolution to a successful finish."
 SRI_support_weapons: "Fiat-Revelli Modello 1914 & Brandt Mortar"
 SRI_support_weapons_desc: "The Fiat-Revelli Modello 1914 is a weapon from the Weltkrieg and Civil War. A powerful machine gun, the weapon has been brought back into service due to a lack of Italian machine guns and the growing tensions on the Italian boot. The Brandt mortar is a relic from the Weltkrieg, a refinement of the British 'Stokes' trench mortar. A simple and effective weapon, the mortar can be dissembled into three parts and requires a crew of ten."

 SRI_support_weapons3_desc: "The Chatelleraut FM Mle 24/29 is a machine gun of French origin that has been sent to Italian military service due to a lack of heavy weapons. While the Chatelleraut features a low fire rate, it is a robust and reliable weapon; well-liked by our troops for its consistency and weight. The Brandt Mle 35 is a 60mm mortar to be used by infantry companies for indirect fire. Simple and effective, it only requires a crew of five to operate."
 SRI_support_weapons4: "MAS AA-42 & Brandt Mle 1942"
 SRI_support_weapons4_desc: "Experience in the Second Weltkrieg has led to an interest in general purpose machine guns to serve a variety of tactical roles. With nearly double the rate of fire of the Chatelleraut, the AA-42 is a belt-fed monster that will mow down anything in its path. The Mle 42 is a considerable improvement over its predecessor, with an emphasis on a greater close quarters support weapon."

These engines were equipped with the 'Italian Bogie', a special frontal bogie designed to run on low radius bends on older lines, as well as the Caprotti valve gear. With the Northwestern lines and the Porrettana line between Bologna and Florence being rapidly electrified in the three-phase AC system, the 625 Group was dispatched to Turin to service the remaining lines, where it remained after the war, remaining in our hands."

More powerful than their predecessors and cheaper to operate, the higher axle load is not a problem on these relatively small engines, allowing them to operate in all but the least mantained lines. However, they remain less powerful than other locomotives, requiring multiple engines to haul the heaviest trains."

 SLO_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Karabina vzor 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."

 SLO_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon.

The Colt company submitted a .276 calibre rifle to the ensuing trials in 1938. The Colt M1937, the latest in a line of guns stemming from a design by J. E. Browning (half brother of John Moses Browning), is a gas-operated design using 108 parts. The M1937 was accepted in service in the end of 1938, after modification at the request of the Ordnance Department from .276 to .30-06 calibre."

Colt did not submit a true carbine design, as it was otherwise pre-occupied, but with the death of J. E. Browning, they put contractor David Marshall Williams, who had begun work on a short-stroke gas piston design, on the project. Williams incorporated his short-stroke piston into an existing Colt prototype and shortened it in line with the requirements of the Ordnance department.

The M1942 was developed in response to rapid improvements in armour which greatly diminished the effectiveness of anti-tank rifles small enough to be man-portable. The M1942 Recoilless Rifle has an effective range of 400 yards, a maximum range of nearly 5,000 yards, and is more accurate compared with the old M1942 anti-tank rifle. It quickly was nicknamed 'pocket artillery' by the soldiers who used it."

 TEX_night_vision2_short: "M1946 Sniperscope"
 TEX_night_vision2_desc: "In response to the poor reception of the M1943 Sniperscope, the Sniperscope M1946 was adopted. With almost twice the effective range of the M1943, a more robust infrared light source, and the T23 flash hider, the M1946 is a vast improvement over its predecessor, though some soldiers complain of the light source bleeding into the visible spectrum and thus giving away their position."

They, of course, evolved into highly capable assault troop and fire support vehicles. Developed by Donald Roebling in 1935, the civilian rescue vehicle "Alligator" was later developed into the M1940, which lacked armour protection and was unreliable when used on hard terrain. The M1940A1 built upon the M1940, with that vehicles most glaring problems fixed."

 TIB_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "With the collapse of the British Raj, the steady trickle of British rifles and ammunition into the country became a deluge and in the span of a year, Tibetan small arms advanced perhaps over fifty years. Further, the influx of German ammunition into Tibet following the German intervention in China led to Tibet converting its SMLE rifles to 7.65×53mm Mauser.

 TIB_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "In response to several commercially successful short rifles produced on the basis of the Mauser 1898 by competing arms manufacturers, the Mauser company developed its owned moderately shortened 1898 rifle. Two related patterns of this design were given the designation 'standard modell' by Mauser. Many small nations, including Tibet purchased these new guns in large quantities; the Tibetan variant is the older of the two and is chambered in 7.65×53mm Mauser.\nSoon after receiving the rifles, the Tibetan government converted several rifles to carbines, cannibalising older British rifles for material."

 TRI_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 TRI_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 TRI_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 TRI_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 TRI_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 TRI_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 TRI_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 TRI_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 TRI_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 TRI_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming."
 TRI_night_vision: "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 TRI_night_vision_short: "Tabby Scope"
 TRI_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 TRI_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 TRI_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 TRI_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 TRI_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 TRI_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 TRI_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 TRI_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 TRI_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 TRI_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 TRI_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 TRI_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 TRI_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 TRI_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 TRI_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 TRI_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 TRI_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 TRI_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 TRI_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 TRI_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

 TRS_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mannlicher M.95/30"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Modell 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 TRS_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabiner Modell 1935"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG M.35"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."
 TRS_infantry_equipment_2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 1939"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Danuvia M.39"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."
 TRS_infantry_equipment_3: "Maschinenkarabiner Modell 1942"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zbrojovka Brno M.42"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."
 TRS_infantry_weapons2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 1934"
 TRS_infantry_weapons2_short: "Steyr-Solothurn M.34"
 TRS_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While a German design by Louis Stange, the  MP 34 was mainly produced by Steyr and was adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army. As common with early submachine guns, this design was heavy, expensive, but reliable, with a horizontal magazine using the potent 9x25mm Mauser cartridge."
 TRS_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 38"
 TRS_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "Zbrojovka Brno M.38"
 TRS_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Seeing the need for a submachine-gun using the standard pistol cartridge of the Army, the Monarchy would adopt the ZK 383, designed by brothers Josef and František Koucký at Zbrojovka Brno, as the MP 38. Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

 TRS_advanced_infantry_weapons2_short: "Danuvia M.43"
 TRS_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While the Danuvia 39M proved successful, its folding magazine was not enough to compensate for its bulky design for vehicle crewmen. The 43M redesign with a folding metal stock and a new, more reliable foldable magazine design allowed it to be much more compact during transport or storage, without sacrificing firepower."

Wanting to make cost-effective use of existing stocks until more Mauser rifles were available, Polish arsenals worked to convert Mosin rifles into carbines chambering the new official cartridge. The wz. 91/98/25 pattern would quickly be adopted by other Oststaaten to modernise their existing stocks."
 # Standardmodell Mauser:
 WHR_infantry_equipment_1: "Piachotnaja Vintouka uz.1924 Mauziera"
 WHR_infantry_equipment_1_short: "V-24"
 WHR_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. Many models were ordered by Belarusian government."
 # MP35:
 WHR_infantry_equipment_2: "Piachotny Pistaliet-Kuliamiot uz.1935 Bierhmana"
 WHR_infantry_equipment_2_short: "PK-35"
 WHR_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "While the sub-machine gun concept was well-proven during the latter phase of the Weltkrieg, many nations see serious shortage of the weapon type as the Second Weltkrieg broke out. Unable to secure the German Army's standard MP-40, the Oststaaten often have to make due with what is commercially available through private firms. The MP-35, designed by Emil Bergmann and notable for its horizontal magazine on the right side, is a popular choice thanks to its relative ruggedness and affordability, along with Bergmann's willingness to license the design."
 # Volkssturmgewehr:
 WHR_infantry_equipment_3: "Samazaradnaja Vintouka uz.1942 Barnickia"
 WHR_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SV-42"
 WHR_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "With Germany's machine carbines becoming increasingly present on the battlefield with its intermediate cartridge and select-fire capabilities, Karl Barnitzke of Waffenfabrik Suhl offered a new design as a cheaper, mass-producible alternative to the M.Kb. 42. The design is very simple and easy to produce, mechanically an enlarged pistol made from extensive use of stamped sheetmetal, using the same intermediate cartridge and 30-round magazines. This semi-automatic rifle, while failing to impress the German Army, caught the interest of Oststaaten, especially Belarus, looking for a cheap alternative to the M.Kb. 42, as the Germans were unwilling to share them. Waffenfabrik Suhl is happy to produce and license the design for local production, significantly raising the firepower of the otherwise-light infantry of Germany's eastern allies."

 # RMN-50
 WHR_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Ruchny Minamiot uz.1943 Najmana"
 WHR_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "RMN-43"
 WHR_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The RMN-43 was developed by Belarusian chemist Isaak Markovich Najman as Belarusian partisans required a portable weapon capable of launching explosives heavier than a rifle grenade, but lighter than a mortar. Najman's \"hand mortar\" was a Mosin rifle with the barrel replaced by a shortened tube of a 5 cm leGrW 36. Using the latter's widely-available ammunition, the Najman Hand Mortar could cause heavy damage in hit-and-run attacks, allowing the attackers to retreat quickly and saving lives as the weapon did not require to be deployed."

 WHR_infantry_at2_desc: "The Raketenpanzerbuchse 54 shoulder-launched anti-tank rocket launchers, nicknamed 'Ofenrohr' ('stove pipe') and the more popular 'Panzerschreck' ('Tank's Fright'), are lightweight infantry weapons developed for the German military, inspired by the rumours about American rocket launchers. Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks' armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers. As a drawback, the R.Pz.B. 54 produces a lot of smoke upon firing. Many shipped over from Germany given Belarus' lack of anti tank weapons."
