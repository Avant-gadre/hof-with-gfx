 ALB_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 ALB_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 ALB_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 ALB_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "Adopted by the Austrian Air Force in 1933, dozens of D.Vs were provided to Albania by the Dual-Monarchy. Basic domestic production on a small scale was also begun."
 ALB_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 ALB_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 ALB_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a licence to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Letov L.52"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "L.52"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š.328.v"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š.328.v"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The Š.328.v was the seaplane derivative of the Š.28 series. It was armed with two forward-firing 8mm machine guns and two more in a flexible mount at the rear, and had a payload capacity of around 500kg."
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Lohner-Fokker T.VIII W/C"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "T.VIII W/C"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Lohner, a company that previously made seaplanes and flying boats for the k.u.k. Seefliegerkorps during the war, acquired the rights to produce the Fokker T.VIII for the Austro-Hungarian Navy."
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.442"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.442"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.442 is the seaplane variant of the WM.44 made for the Seefliegerkorps, intended for Adriatic and Mediterranean anti-ship operations."

 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Praga E.51"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "E.51"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.31"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "WM.31"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arose over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.50"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "WM.50"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Avia F.39"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "F.39"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newer models were developed."
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š-50"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š-50"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero Vodochody A.300"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "A.300"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconnaissance aircraft."
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.311"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov L.11"
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "L.11"
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Based on a jet fighter design by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the L.11 adapted the design into a fast and light jet bomber for multiple roles, hoping to replace the Monarchy's fleet of older prop-driven tactical bombers."
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero L.44"
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "L.44"
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "With the reliability of jet engines increasing and competition ever-so fierce, Aero tackled the challenge to design a next-generation fast-bomber, culminating into the L.44 fast bomber."

 BOS_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."

 BOS_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 BOS_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 BOS_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135.

 CRO_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 CRO_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 CRO_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 CRO_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 CRO_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 CRO_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 CRO_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 CRO_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 CRO_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 CRO_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 CRO_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 CRO_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 CRO_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 CRO_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 CRO_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 CRO_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 CRO_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 CRO_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 CRO_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 CRO_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 CRO_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
 CRO_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
 CRO_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
 CRO_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a licence to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
 CRO_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Letov L.52"
 CRO_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "L.52"
 CRO_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

 CRO_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š.328.v"
 CRO_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š.328.v"
 CRO_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The Š.328.v was the seaplane derivative of the Š.28 series. It was armed with two forward-firing 8mm machine guns and two more in a flexible mount at the rear, and had a payload capacity of around 500kg."
 CRO_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Lohner-Fokker T.VIII W/C"
 CRO_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "T.VIII W/C"

 CRO_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Praga E.51"
 CRO_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "E.51"
 CRO_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."
 CRO_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.31"
 CRO_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "WM.31"
 CRO_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arose over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."
 CRO_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.50"
 CRO_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "WM.50"
 CRO_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Avia F.39"
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "F.39"
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newer models were developed."
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š-50"
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š-50"
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero Vodochody A.300"
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "A.300"
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconnaissance aircraft."
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.311"
 CRO_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."
 CRO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov L.11"
 CRO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "L.11"
 CRO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Based on a jet fighter design by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the L.11 adapted the design into a fast and light jet bomber for multiple roles, hoping to replace the Monarchy's fleet of older prop-driven tactical bombers."

 GAL_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 GAL_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 GAL_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 GAL_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 GAL_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 GAL_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 GAL_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135.

Bloch proposed the MB.170, a twin-engined, low-winged cantilever monoplane, which was recognised as a very promising aircraft. After initial testing, the ventral dome was removed and the project underwent significant changes, transforming the MB.170 into a heavy fighter, while development of the different versions of the MB.170 was requested."

The Amiot 140 is a high-winged cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction, with corrugated wing skinning and a fixed tail wheel undercarriage. Adopted in 1934, the modified Amiot 143 was practically retrained into a night bomber, but due to last-minute modifications, it was adopted according to the BCR classification."

The MB.210 is a twin-engined low-winged monoplane with a fixed undercarriage. Although the aircraft has established itself as an extremely durable and reliable aircraft, practically not suffering from any serious defects, it is noted by many that its thrust-to-weight ratio is insufficient, and its engines are unreliable by modern standards."

 SCA_fighter_equipment_0: "Svenska Aero J 6 Jaktfalken"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_0_short: "J 6 Jaktfalken"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "An old interwar biplane fighter built by Svenska Aero first in the '20s, and then by AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstädernas Aeroplanavdelning, used in all Scandinavia. Despite its efficiency for patrol and reconnaissance missions, it has had its day in our air force and will be not suitable for the requirements of the modern air warfare."
 SCA_fighter_equipment_1: "Serversky EP-106 J 9"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J 9"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "An American built fighter, made by the Serverski company. The US air military chose its competitor, the P-36, from the Curtiss company, but it's reliable and perfectly fills our needs for our missions above Scandinavia. After some negotiations, Seversky sold us the manufacturing rights and the plans, allowing us to produce it."
 SCA_fighter_equipment_2: "FFVS J 22"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_2_short: "J 22"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The J 22, designed by Kungliga Flygförvaltningens Flygverkstad i Stockholm, is our first locally designed monoplane fighter. Appreciated by our pilots for its maniablity, it is also easy to maintain. It should allow us to defend Scandinavia efficiently from any threats."
 SCA_fighter_equipment_3: "FFVS J 27"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_3_short: "J 27"
 SCA_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The air warfare has evolved during the second Weltkrieg, and because of the intensive aerial fights above the Baltic, a lot of foreign planes could not find their way back to their home bases or just crashed on our shores. After there capture (or their recovery for the unluckiest ones), our technical units studied a lot these fighters of a new kind. Because the J 21 didn't met the needed requirements to be an efficient fighter, those studies resulted into the J 27, a modern fighter inspired from German and American designs, but mostly from the British Supermarine 'Spitfire'. A powerful engine, a high maniability, a contra-rotating propeller, powerful armament... our 'Norden Super Spitfire' will be a nightmare for the countries which dare to invade us!"
 SCA_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Kjeller-SAAB J 21R"
 SCA_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J 21R"
 SCA_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "After years of R&D, we've finally managed to build a jet fighter. The piston engine fighter J 21, which wasn't very efficient as a fighter, that's a fact. But it's a reliable and strong platform. Repowered with a jet engine and armed with 20 mm guns, the J 21R is entirely capable of defending our skies against the air invaders of the next years. No more propellers, time is for jets now."
 SCA_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Kjeller-SAAB 29 Tunnan"
 SCA_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "Kjeller-SAAB 29"
 SCA_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the good result obtained with the J 21R, time is now to build a new jet fighter, with a new cell and not rebuilt from an old aircraft. The J 29 is the climax of our air industry: it has an advanced radar, bigger fuel tanks, air to air missiles and high speed. If we continue to build planes like the 'Tunnan', the skies of Scandinavia are guaranteed for the future."

Their second model drew interest from the Danish military, which eventually contracted for the production of a ground attack variant on the craft."
 SCA_CAS_equipment_2: "SAAB B 17"
 SCA_CAS_equipment_2_short: "B 17"
 SCA_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "After studying the latest attacker aircraft designs of the other powers in Europe, we have successfully managed to create a local aircraft capable to conduct efficiently air-to-ground support missions. The B 17, designed by SAAB, is well powered, capable of use a lot of bombs and can perform dive bombing. Its landing gears are also modular, which allows us to install skis and floats."
 SCA_CAS_equipment_3: "Kjeller-SAAB A 21"
 SCA_CAS_equipment_3_short: "A 21"
 SCA_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "The Saab A-21 was first a fighter named J 21, but because it shown an inadequate performance for its fighter role. Despite this, the Saab design bureau realised its cell would be an excellent platform for an attacker. Its unique push-pull configuration, its powerful engine and the choice of loadout make it a powerful CAS."

This acts as a the foundation for future Swedish naval bombers development."

 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "SAAB J 19"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J 19"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Our J6 and J 9 fighters are very limited for long range operations. In case of a war, they couldn't be able to escort our bombers or intercept those of the enemy at long range and high altitude. We were forced to study a new design of plane, which resulted in the J 19. Equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks and 20 mm canons, it will be able to catch the enemy, even at a far distance."
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "SAAB J 23"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "J 23"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of the J 19, we had to improve its design and capabilities. The J 23 is inspired by our neighbours designs and allow our air force to be more efficient. Still no radar, but no more additional fuel tanks. It's definitively a good solution to protect our neutrality from the exterior and keep an eye above the Baltic sea."
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "SAAB J 24"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "J 24"
 SCA_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Heavier, bigger and stronger, the Saab J 24 is a last gen interceptor. Two powerful engines, a heavy armament, a pressurised cockpit, an advanced radar and a big fuel tank allow it to conduct air interceptions even in the worst flight conditions, wherever the enemy is. It's the best plane of its kind we've ever built."

 SLV_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 SLV_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 SLV_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 SLV_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 SLV_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 SLV_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 SLV_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 SLV_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 SLV_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 SLV_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 SLV_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 SLV_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 SLV_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."

 SLO_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 SLO_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 SLO_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 SLO_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 SLO_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 SLO_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 SLO_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."

 SLO_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 SLO_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 SLO_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 SLO_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 SLO_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."

 TRS_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 TRS_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 TRS_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 TRS_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 TRS_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
 TRS_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 TRS_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 TRS_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 TRS_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
