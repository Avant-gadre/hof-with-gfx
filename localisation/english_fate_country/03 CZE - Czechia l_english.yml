##Event
 czech.1.t: "Comintern membership"
 czech.1.d: "Our relations with the Czechs have been spotty in the past, but recently their politics have taken a sharp turn towards the right side of history. Combined with increasing pressure from Germany and a lack of faith in the ability of the Western democracies to protect them has resulted in a formal request to join the Comintern."
 czech.1.a: "They are more than welcome."
 czech.1.b: "They are not ready yet."
 czech.2.d: "[SOV.GetLeader] has accepted our request to join the Comintern. Our delegation has joined the Executive Committee with full voting rights."
 czech.3.d: "[SOV.GetLeader] has refused our request to join the Comintern, without giving any reason."
 czech.3.a: "So much for our Slavic ties..."
 czech.4.t: "The Romanian Problem"
 czech.4.d: "Relations with Romania have always been strained by their occupation of our rightful territory of Bessarabia, but as if that was not enough the entire nation impedes our ability to come to the aid of our [From.GetName] allies. Those same allies have now proposed a solution:Partition Romania between us to solve this problem once and for all!"
 czech.4.a: "Brilliant in its simplicity."
 czech.4.b: "We'll find another solution."
 czech.5.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has approved our solution to the Romania problem. The military is ready, and the campaign can begin at our discretion."
 czech.6.d: "[From.GetLeader] has turned down our proposition concerning the Romania problem. It appears that he still has plans for Romania."
 czech.6.a: "It was worth a shot."
 czech.7.t: "The Polish Situation"
 czech.7.d: "From the very beginning of our quest to liberate the workers of the world, Poland has been nothing but trouble. Now our [From.GetName] allies have made an interesting proposition: Poland has taken land from both of our nations, so why not repay the favor and divide Poland between us?"
 czech.7.a: "Why not, indeed."
 czech.8.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has approved our proposed solution to the Polish Situation. We will begin operations as soon as the order is given."
 czech.9.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has not approved our proposal. We must bide our time and consider other options."
 czech.10.d: "Since the end of the Great War, Poland has occupied German land. As if that wasn't enough, they have constantly attacked their neighbors to aggressively expand their territory. Our [From.GetName] allies have come to the same conclusion as us: To ensure the peace in Europe, the Polish state must be eliminated."
 czech.10.a: "Let's get to it."
 czech.11.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has approved our plan to deal with the Polish Situation. We can strike as soon as preparations are completed."
 czech.12.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has rejected our solution to the Polish Situation. Time will tell if another opportunity arises."
 czech.14.t: "The Slovak Rebellion"
 czech.14.d: "Ever since we removed them from the government, the Slovak Leaders have been burning with resentment and inciting the population to violence. Today, their words have finally succeeded in bringing about the war they so desperately wanted. The Slovak Rebellion has begun."
 czech.14.a: "If they want war, then they shall have it."
 czech.15.d: "The last bastions of Slovak power have been crushed. The rebellion is at an end."
 czech.15.a: "Victory!"
 czech.16.t: "Czechs in the Axis?"
 czech.16.d: "Despite initial misgivings, the Czechs have come to consider Bolshevism as the imminent threat it really is, and are now requesting to join the Axis powers. The government of [CZE.GetLeader] has specifically stated that this does not impact the question of the Sudetenland in any way."
 czech.17.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our request to join the Axis!"
 czech.17.a: "Excellent!"
 czech.18.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused our request to join the Axis!"
 czech.18.a: "Troublesome."
 czech.19.t: "Dishonor Before Death"
 czech.19.d: "The government of [From.GetLeader] has realized what we have known all along: [From.GetNameDef] can only continue to exist under our protection. Although this precludes the possibility of directly occupying their land, it might be better to have a willing ally, and avoids any meddling by foreign actors."
 czech.20.t: "Dishonor Before Death"
 czech.20.d: "[From.GetLeader] has accepted our offer. A [From.GetAdjective] plentipotary has arrived in Prague to coordinate policies."
 czech.20.a: "It's the only way."
 czech.21.t: "Dishonor Before Death"
 czech.21.d: "When presented with our proposal, [From.GetLeader] reportedly exclaimed \"Not in a Thousand Years!\", before launching into a lengthy tirade about the inferiority of our people, our system of government, and the leadership qualities of [CZE.GetLeader]. No official refusal has been submitted, but our ambassador holds little hope."
 czech.21.a: "Perhaps it is for the best."
 czech.22.t: "The Sudeten question"
 czech.22.d: "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has offered up the Sudetenland as a step towards coming to a mutual understanding. On one hand, this is a great opportunity to acquire a rich state for little cost and with little danger. On the other hand, creating a crisis over the Sudetenland would be an excellent opportunity to show the world that the so-called Great Powers holding up the Treaty of Versailles are toothless and morally inferior."
 czech.23.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer. [From.GetAdjective] troops have moved into the Sudetenland to the cheers of the local population."
 czech.23.a: "They can ask no more, surely."
 czech.24.d: "[From.GetLeader] has refused our offer to hand over the Sudetenland. He did not give any reason for this move, but the [From.GetAdjective] decision has sent a shockwave through the military, who believes the Germans might have bigger plans for us."
 czech.24.a: "Wait and see."
 czech.25.t: "Yugoslavia in the Entente"
 czech.25.d: "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has decided to reaffirm the 'Little Entente' alliance, which had lapsed in recent years in the face of growing German influence. Their foreign minister was recently in our capital to discuss whether we would be interested in joining the alliance as a permanent member."
 czech.26.d: "[From.GetName] has agreed to join the Entente. A military delegation has arrived to discuss defensive arrangements."
 czech.27.d: "While [From.GetLeader] agreed to meet our delegation, he has so far refused to commit his country to join the Entente. The [From.GetAdjective]s seem to be worried that joining our alliance might destabilize the careful balance of power in the region."
 czech.28.t: "Romania in the Entente"
 czech.32.t: "Czech-Hungarian Rapprochement"
 czech.32.d: "The Entente lead by [From.GetNameDef] has long been aimed at containing our nation. However, as German power grows, [From.GetNameDef] feels increasingly threatened from that direction. unwilling to face a threat on two sides, [From.GetLeader] now seeks to come to an understanding with us. \n\nOur government is split on the issue. One faction believes that an agreement with [From.GetNameDef] is the first step to breaking the encirclement, while the other faction points to the fact that this would no doubt draw the wrath of [GER.GetLeader]."
 czech.33.d: "[From.GetLeader] was surprisingly open to our offer. We have signed a Treaty of Mutual Friendship, affirming that neither of us has any territorial claims on the other."
 czech.33.a: "Better than expected!"
 czech.34.d: "Surprising few, [From.GetLeader] has rejected our offer, citing our unwillingness to surrender certain territories to Hungary."
 czech.34.a: "Nothing new, then."

 czech.35.t: "restore democracy?"
 czech.35.d: "Whether we are involved in the Carpathian War or not, [CZE.GetLeader] the deadline for the emergency term of His Excellency the President will not change, and the people are longing for the end of the rule by decree to achieve the long-promised democracy."
 czech.35.a: "The president refused to restore democracy, so..."
 czech.35.b: "Emergency decree, revoked!"

 czech.36.t: "Purchase of Czech artillery"
 czech.36.d: "What to buy?"
 czech.36.a: "100 units of artillery." 
 czech.36.b: "100 units of anti-aircraft artillery." 
 czech.36.c: "100 units of anti-tank guns." 
 
 czech.37.t: "Purchase Czech military vehicles"

 CZE_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Karabina vzor 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 CZE_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabina vzor 1935"
 CZE_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG vz. 35"
 CZE_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

 CZE_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."

 CZE_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zbrojovka Brno vz. 42"
 CZE_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."
 CZE_infantry_weapons2: "Kulometná pistole vzor 1934"
 CZE_infantry_weapons2_short: "Steyr-Solothurn vz. 34"
 CZE_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While a German design by Louis Stange, the  MP 34 was mainly produced by Steyr and was adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army. As common with early submachine guns, this design was heavy, expensive, but reliable, with a horizontal magazine using the potent 9x25mm Mauser cartridge."

 CZE_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "Zbrojovka Brno vz. 38"
 CZE_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Seeing the need for a submachine-gun using the standard pistol cartridge of the Army, the Monarchy would adopt the ZK 383, designed by brothers Josef and František Koucký at Zbrojovka Brno, as the MP 38. Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

 CZE_advanced_infantry_weapons2_short: "Danuvia vz. 43"
 CZE_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While the Danuvia 39M proved successful, its folding magazine was not enough to compensate for its bulky design for vehicle crewmen. The 43M redesign with a folding metal stock and a new, more reliable foldable magazine design allowed it to be much more compact during transport or storage, without sacrificing firepower."

As a stop-gap measure to improve the mobility of its motorised infantry, the Armee-Oberkommando assigned numerous artillery tractors, mostly of the Praga T-series, to its rapid divisions, redesignating them as tracked troop transports until proper armoured carriers could be introduced."

 CZE_mechanized_equipment_2_desc: "The Saurer RR-7 was a hybrid armoured vehicle that could use both tracks or wheels. It was introduced as an artillery tractor in 1937, but proved to be a far more versatile vehicle with its light armour and high mobility. Not only would it fill the role of a reconnaissance vehicle, but also that of a troop transport, making it the Monarchy's first armoured vehicle of that type."

 CZE_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."

 CZE_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."

 CZE_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 CZE_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers.

 CZE_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."

 CZE_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."

 CZE_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."

 CZE_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
