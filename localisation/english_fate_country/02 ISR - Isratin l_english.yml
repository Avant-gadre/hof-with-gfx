##Ideas
 ISR_one_state_solution: "One-state Solution"
 ISR_one_state_solution_desc: ""The decades-long efforts of the Zionists are becoming a reality:an independent, democratic state of Israel seems to have been presented to the world, and the land God gave to the Jews has finally been returned to them. But all this changed a decade ago. Since Theresia became the Speaker of the World Zionist Organization, the Zionist agenda has been modified on a number of key issues:the Basel Program was abolished and replaced by the Babel Program, which Theresia herself drafted. Zionism ceased to be merely an ideology of the "return of Israel" and placed greater emphasis on the responsibility of the Jewish people to the original inhabitants of the land:to integrate them into a peaceful, united democratic state and to improve the condition of all people in the country. Although opposed by many Zionists, this change was supported by the "Bund" (the General Union of Jewish Workers of Lithuania, Poland and Russia). The British government, led by King Arthur, also declared that it welcomed the plan, and thus a binary state of Jews and Arabs was created. As a sign of respect for Jews and Arabs, the state was no longer called Isreal, but Isratin. Not surprisingly, critics of Zionism continue to criticize Theresia's "reforms" for not changing the colonialist nature of Zionism, and perhaps they are right. The results of this bizarre social experiment will perhaps only be tested by history."""
 ISR_Babel_Program: "Babel Program"
 ISR_Babel_Program_desc: "Babel Program was an alternative to the Basel Program, the platform of the World Zionist Organization, which emphasized not only the need to secure a land for the Jews and to fight against world anti-Semitism, but also the social responsibility of the Jews towards the indigenous people of the land of immigration. This plan was soon put into practice by Theresia. It included a series of plans to build housing for Jews and Arabs, programs to develop the civilian economy, and attempts to reform and expand the traditional Israeli kibbutz (collective farm). At the same time, the Babel Program included a series of plans for military defense to prevent the fledgling state from being easily destroyed by outside forces."
 
 ISR_Aliyah_movement: "Aliyah Movement"
