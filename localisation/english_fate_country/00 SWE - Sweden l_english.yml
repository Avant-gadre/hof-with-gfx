 SWE_fighter_equipment_0: "Svenska Aero J 6 Jaktfalken"
 SWE_fighter_equipment_0_short: "J 6 Jaktfalken"
 SWE_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "An old interwar biplane fighter built by Svenska Aero first in the '20s, and then by AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstädernas Aeroplanavdelning, used in all Scandinavia. Despite its efficiency for patrol and reconnaissance missions, it has had its day in our air force and will be not suitable for the requirements of the modern air warfare."
 SWE_fighter_equipment_1: "Serversky EP-106 J 9"
 SWE_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J 9"
 SWE_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "An American built fighter, made by the Serverski company. The US air military chose its competitor, the P-36, from the Curtiss company, but it's reliable and perfectly fills our needs for our missions above Sweden. After some negotiations, Seversky sold us the manufacturing rights and the plans, allowing us to produce it."
 SWE_fighter_equipment_2: "FFVS J 22"
 SWE_fighter_equipment_2_short: "J 22"
 SWE_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The J 22, designed by Kungliga Flygförvaltningens Flygverkstad i Stockholm, is our first locally designed monoplane fighter. Appreciated by our pilots for its maniablity, it is also easy to maintain. It should allow us to defend Sweden efficiently from any threats."
 SWE_fighter_equipment_3: "FFVS J 27"
 SWE_fighter_equipment_3_short: "J 27"
 SWE_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The air warfare has evolved during the second Weltkrieg, and because of the intensive aerial fights above the Baltic, a lot of foreign planes could not find their way back to their home bases or just crashed on our shores. After there capture (or their recovery for the unluckiest ones), our technical units studied a lot these fighters of a new kind. Because the J 21 didn't met the needed requirements to be an efficient fighter, those studies resulted into the J 27, a modern fighter inspired from German and American designs, but mostly from the British Supermarine 'Spitfire'. A powerful engine, a high maniability, a contra-rotating propeller, powerful armament... our 'Svensk Super Spitfire' will be a nightmare for the countries which dare to invade us!"
 SWE_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "SAAB J 21R"
 SWE_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J 21R"
 SWE_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "After years of R&D, we've finally managed to build a jet fighter. The piston engine fighter J 21, which wasn't very efficient as a fighter, that's a fact. But it's a reliable and strong platform. Repowered with a jet engine and armed with 20 mm guns, the J 21R is entirely capable of defending our skies against the air invaders of the next years. No more propellers, time is for jets now."
 SWE_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "SAAB 29 Tunnan"
 SWE_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "SAAB 29"
 SWE_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the good result obtained with the J 21R, time is now to build a new jet fighter, with a new cell and not rebuilt from an old aircraft. The J 29 is the climax of our air industry: it has an advanced radar, bigger fuel tanks, air to air missiles and high speed. If we continue to build planes like the 'Tunnan', the skies of Sweden are guaranteed for the future."

 SWE_cv_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "A prototype airframe. Eventhough J 25HS performs well in testing, only a few airframe was constructed before the FFVS J 27 supercedes it."

 SWE_CAS_equipment_1: "Northrop A-17 B 5"
 SWE_CAS_equipment_1_short: "B 5"
 SWE_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "The A-17 is an American attack bomber designed and built by Northrop. It's a simple and a reliable plane, easy to maintain. It is a bit limited, but greatly plays his role of air support for our ground forces. Thanks to the American engineering, the aircraft cell isn't complex and allows us to install winter equipment, including skis for the landing gear."
 SWE_CAS_equipment_2: "SAAB B 17"
 SWE_CAS_equipment_2_short: "B 17"
 SWE_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "After studying the latest attacker aircraft designs of the other powers in Europe, we have successfully managed to create a local aircraft capable to conduct efficiently air-to-ground support missions. The B 17, designed by SAAB, is well powered, capable of use a lot of bombs and can perform dive bombing. Its landing gears are also modular, which allows us to install skis and floats."
 SWE_CAS_equipment_3: "SAAB A 21"
 SWE_CAS_equipment_3_short: "A 21"
 SWE_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "The Saab A-21 was first a fighter named J 21, but because it shown an inadequate performance for its fighter role. Despite this, the Saab design bureau realised its cell would be an excellent platform for an attacker. Its unique push-pull configuration, its powerful engine and the choice of loadout make it a powerful CAS."

 SWE_cv_CAS_equipment_1: "Serversky EP-106 B 9HS"
 SWE_cv_CAS_equipment_1_short: "B 9HS"
 SWE_cv_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "With the Navy finding the modified version of the B5 unsatisfied, the already existing J 9HS variant is thus modifed with extra hard point for greater bomb-carrying capacity for the this particular task instead."

 SWE_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "T 17S"
 SWE_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "A naval variant of our B 17, designed by Saab. The modular landing gears has been completely replaced by floats and the tail has been improved to allow him to move better on the water. It's the perfect aircraft for naval patrols or ship attack, which can also be used as a reconnaissance seaplane for our navy."

 SWE_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "T/J 6HS Jaktfalken"
 SWE_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The now old biplane airframe is modified to carry air-dropped torpedoes - acting more as a proof-of-concept for future designs rather than being converted en-massed as its slow speed make it an easy target in real combat situations. This acts as a the foundation for future Swedish naval bombers development."
 SWE_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "FFVS T 22HS"
 SWE_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "T 22HS"
 SWE_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "A variant of the J 22HS modified to carry air-dropped torpedoes. Its easy-to-maintain characteristics make it suitable for shipboard deployments to act as the first line of defence should the enemy fleet be sighted."
 SWE_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "SAAB SB 21HS"
 SWE_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "SB 21HS"
 SWE_cv_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "This piston-powered airframe is the first, and the last to be specifically designed as naval bombers - as Swedish plane manufacturers managed to perfected their jet engine construction blueprints soon after."

 SWE_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "SAAB J 19"
 SWE_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "J 19"
 SWE_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Our J6 and J 9 fighters are very limited for long range operations. In case of a war, they couldn't be able to escort our bombers or intercept those of the enemy at long range and high altitude. We were forced to study a new design of plane, which resulted in the J 19. Equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks and 20 mm canons, it will be able to catch the enemy, even at a far distance."
 SWE_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "SAAB J 23"
 SWE_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "J 23"
 SWE_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of the J 19, we had to improve its design and capabilities. The J 23 is inspired by our neighbours designs and allow our air force to be more efficient. Still no radar, but no more additional fuel tanks. It's definitively a good solution to protect our neutrality from the exterior and keep an eye above the Baltic sea."
 SWE_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "SAAB J 24"
 SWE_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "J 24"
 SWE_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Heavier, bigger and stronger, the Saab J 24 is a last gen interceptor. Two powerful engines, a heavy armament, a pressurised cockpit, an advanced radar and a big fuel tank allow it to conduct air interceptions even in the worst flight conditions, wherever the enemy is. It's the best plane of its kind we've ever built."
