 POL_abolish_segregated_seating_desc: "Poland is a landscape of people of different ethnicities, cultures, and faiths, yet in our education we keep them separate. If they truly are all Poles, then they should be together and share ideas freely. Segregated seating is little but a constraint on our education and must be abolished."
 POL_agrarian_reform: "Agrarian Reform"
 POL_agrarian_reform_desc: "A peasant's strike is on the horizon. All across the country, food prices are skyrocketing, and both our disjointed industry and the government's lack of action to aid Poland's poorest cause great unrest in the peasantry. With sufficient investment and reform however, we should be able to become more than capable of meeting the peasants' demands."
 POL_invest_in_eastern_poland: "Invest in Eastern Poland"
 POL_invest_in_eastern_poland_desc: "The east is a barren and desolate place, neglected entirely by both the Russians and the Polish state. There is a plethora of ideal locations for factories, and plenty of men with which to work them, should we choose to invest in such things."
 POL_complete_the_plan: "Complete the Plan"
 POL_complete_the_plan_desc: "The time has come to reflect upon the Four Year Plan and prepare plans for the next four years of Polish industrialization! The more we have invested in Poland and her industry, the better prepared we will be for what lurks in Poland's industrial future."
 POL_woo_the_sanation_generals: "Woo the Sanation Generals"
 POL_woo_the_sanation_generals_desc: "The Sanationist military staff are disgruntled and disloyal towards the regime. Some would say that a purge of military staff is necessitated by the Sanation's own hubris, but we know these men are simply too valuable to be replaced."
 POL_sanationist_army: "A Sanationist Army"
 POL_sanationist_army_desc: "With a loyal Sanation upper command under our control, the time has come to utilize the old guard's experience among the troops."
 POL_purge_the_sanation: "Purge the Sanation"
 POL_purge_the_sanation_desc: "The Sanation generals are fickle and disloyal and have proved themselves to have allegiances moreso to themselves than to Poland herself! We must purge our high command of all generals involved in the Sanation coup!"

 POL_new_military_academy: "New Military Academy"
 POL_new_military_academy_desc: "Our high command lays barren and empty, but this leaves a golden opportunity to plant the seeds for the future; ensuring that future generals are loyal to our nation and highly educated in the art of war. By funding military academies across the nation, we will ensure that any new Polish officers are of a higher caliber than any of their predecessors."
 POL_attract_foreign_motors: "Attract Foreign Motor Companies"
 POL_attract_foreign_motors_desc: "While some would insist that the original Polish designs of LRL are where the future of Polish motorized equipment lies, the question remains why should we reinvent the wheel when we can merely realign it? Foreign motor companies have mastered the art of making materials cheaper, faster, and harder so it would seem prudent to invite them to design equipment for us!"
 POL_adaptive_designs: "Adaptive Designs"
 POL_adaptive_designs_desc: "Maintaining our licence for foreign designers is coming to be of great expense to the state, but perhaps there are ways we can repurpose our military designs to be of use in the private sector. By distributing a portion of our materials to the wealthy, we may mitigate the cost of maintaining the expense of employing these foreign design companies."
 POL_complete_april_constitution: "Complete the April Constitution"
 POL_complete_april_constitution_desc: "The April Constitution is a series of reforms designed to centralize Poland into a more centralized authoritarian regime under the President.

 POL_consolidate_sanation_government: "Consolidate the Sanation Government"
 POL_consolidate_sanation_government_desc: "Since the death of Józef Piłsudski, the Sanation government has been fragmented and disorganized. The government has split into three branches: The Castle, the Sanation Left, and the Sanation Right. It's uncertain if the Castle can maintain control of the dictatorship, but the government must leave this state of indecision soon if it is to have any hope of withstanding the oncoming storm of war."
 POL_the_castle: "The Castle"
 POL_the_castle_desc: "The Castle represents the governors ruling from Warsaw Castle under the leadership of Ignacy Mościcki.

 POL_eliminate_socialist_parties: "Eliminate Socialist Parties"
 POL_eliminate_socialist_parties_desc: "Socialism is an ideology rapidly taking hold of the world, but it is fundamentally incompatible with the ideals of the Castle government. The left oppose us in both the form of agrarian and social-democrat parties, and in the traitorous communist parties.

 POL_dissolve_the_sejm: "Dissolve the Sejm"
 POL_dissolve_the_sejm_desc: "The Sejm has continued to exist under the Sanation government as a mere token of the democracy Poland once embraced. The time has come however to strip the Sejm of all powers and grant all power to the Senate and the Senators of the Castle."

 POL_the_sanation_left: "The Sanation Left"
 POL_the_sanation_left_desc: "Loyal to Walery Sławek, the Sanation Left represents those who feel Sławek is the true successor to Piłsudski and seek accommodation with the opposition, rather than ostracising them from government entirely as the Right and Castle would. Though cooperation with them will likely upset the Sanation Right, the leftists hold internal power that we need to build a competent cabinet of ministers."
 POL_modus_vivendi: "Modus Vivendi"
 POL_modus_vivendi_desc: "The Sanation Left seeks accommodation with the opposition within our state; granting them seats of power within the government. With members of the opposition given proper representation, they may no longer seek to oppose the Dictatorship."

 POL_legion_of_merit: "The Legion of Merit"
 POL_legion_of_merit_desc: "A conception of Walery Sławek, the Legion of Merit would award a privileged position to any citizens of the republic who have proven themselves to be of outstanding benefit to the state. The award would guarantee the individual a position in the senate, and any individual invited to the Legion would certainly have little reason to grow disgruntled with the regime."
 POL_the_left_chairman: "The Left Chairman"
 POL_the_left_chairman_desc: "The Sanations Left and Right are fundamentally incompatible ideologically. While we may be able to benefit from reforms proposed by the Right, it is the Left who has the best interests of Poland at heart and perhaps by granting them greater powers, we may sideline the Right entirely…"
 POL_common_organization_of_society: "Common Organization of Society"
 POL_common_organization_of_society_desc: "Sławek has long had the ambition to replace the BBWR with a power structure he calls the “Common Organization of Society”. This structure would uniquely grant great local autonomy to Poland's states and townships, while centralizing the government in a strong authoritarian regime ready to interfere in local governance in times of war. With the Left in power, Sławek may at last fulfill his ambition."
 POL_dissolve_the_bbwr: "A New King in the Castle"
 POL_dissolve_the_bbwr_desc: "The Left have grown so influential and powerful within the Dictatorship that Mościcki's title of President seems entirely symbolic at best. All that remains is to make it official and disband all traces of the Castle from government, bringing Sławek to the lofty peak of power in the state."
 POL_the_sanation_right: "The Sanation Right"
 POL_the_sanation_right_desc: "Followers of Edward Rydz-Śmigły, the Sanation Right is primarily composed of generals and high ranking military staff. The military powerhouse of the Sanation government, the Right are in prime position to take control of the government, but granting powers and concessions to them may ensure their continued loyalty and potential incorporation into the Castle."
 POL_support_right_paramilitaries: "Support Right-Wing Paramilitarism"
 POL_support_right_paramilitaries_desc: "The Falangists of Poland's political landscape have often been described as fanatical, fascist, and even comparable with the Nazis, but their rhetoric is appealing to Polish patriots, and Jerzy Rutkowski proposes establishing a paramilitary composed of youthful volunteers ready to fight and die for Polish independence."
 POL_codify_national_unity: "Codify the Camp of National Unity"
 POL_codify_national_unity_desc: "The Camp of National Unity represents the joint interests of the Sanation Right and the Castle, and thus far the policies and goals of the group have been vague.

 POL_second_man_of_the_state: "Second Man of the State"
 POL_second_man_of_the_state_desc: "The Sanation Left has been sufficiently sidelined and now, Śmigły and Mościcki are able to completely oust the Left of all influence in the government. Śmigły shall be made the “second man”, meaning that in times of war, Mościcki must surrender his seat as President to the Sanation Right and the military."
 POL_ozon: "Triumph of OZN"
 POL_ozon_desc: "Though the agreement is that Mościcki surrenders his seat in times of war, it is clear that the threats on our border are more than we can stand against and war is on the horizon.

 POL_lithuanian_ultimatum: "Lithuanian Ultimatum"
 POL_lithuanian_ultimatum_desc: "For years, we have officially been in a state of war with the Lithuanians though nobody has taken aggressive action since the annexation of Vilnius. With Germany storming across the continent taking what it desires with the mere threat of war, perhaps we may do the same for Lithuania; demanding an end to these hostilities for the sake of both our nations."
 POL_lithuanian_alliance: "Lithuanian Alliance"
 POL_lithuanian_alliance_desc: "We have made peace with our former enemies to the north, but now we must learn how to move forward together as friends. Our enemies and allies are common, so it is only natural that the Lithuanians be aligned with the same powers as us."
 POL_lithuanian_annexation: "Demand Lithuanian Annexation"
 POL_lithuanian_annexation_desc: "With the German anschluss of Austria, it's become evident that old unions can be restored if one merely asks for it with some aggression.

 POL_restore_the_sejm: "Restore the Sejm"

 POL_the_prusya_line: "The Prussian Line"

 POL_invest_anti_air_desc: "We are unlikely to be capable of outproducing the Germans in the air, however we need not outnumber them when we can instead invest heavily in constructing anti-air weaponry on the ground. With Bofors in every state, German pilots won't get far before meeting our guns."

 POL_sabotage_polish_industry_desc: "Our enemies have far stronger armies than ours and in greater number. While it would be nice to entertain the idea that we shan't lose ground, the truth is we are unlikely to hold out forever.

 POL_fortification_of_ukraine: "Fortification of Ukraine"
 POL_fortification_of_ukraine_desc: "The east is underdeveloped and agrarian, and Polish Ukraine remains a soft spot in Poland's south primed for an invasion. Some basic fortifications must be constructed along the border if we are to keep our nation safe!"
 POL_supply_the_rail_nexus: "Supply the Rail Nexus"
 POL_supply_the_rail_nexus_desc: "The railways in Eastern Poland are in a sorry state, not nearly comparable to Poland's central region. A war with [SOV.GetNameDef] would be won or lost with the control of supply, and a decent supply chain to our own men would be a great place to begin."
 POL_local_eastern_plans: "Local Eastern Plans"
 POL_local_eastern_plans_desc: "Often our own military staff can be trusted to devise plans amongst themselves, but in a war like this, direct intervention on a small scale is necessary.

 POL_the_north_sea: "The North Sea"
 POL_the_north_sea_desc: "Before we can even begin to consider swaying the neutral powers in the North to join our alliance, we must lay the groundwork on the global diplomatic stage.

 POL_invite_sweden_desc: "The Swedes have had an intriguing concept of neutrality in these times of growing conflict.

 POL_invite_norway: "Invite Norway"
 POL_invite_norway_desc: "It is no secret that the Germans have ambitions and designs for Norway, and already there are men within their nation ready to collaborate with these foreign invaders.

 POL_the_mediterranean: "The Mediterranean"
 POL_the_mediterranean_desc: "Between Poland and the Mediterranean is a herd of lambs with wolves at their back.

Although the Sanacja military government tries its best to maintain the authoritarian rule of the government,it could not directly destroy the democratic procedure,and could only participate in the elections in the form of political party.The most influential opposition party,Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe or Polish People's Party,after the new leader Flametail chosen,continues to launch a massive election campaign,with great ambitions to overthrow the Sanacja government with one stone.Another force that cannot be ignored is Piłsudski's old enemy,National Party under the National Democratic Movement or Endecja under directorship of Roman Dmowski,they demand the establishment of a single nation-state with the Greater Poland region at its core,and implement a strong policy of assimilation to ethnic minorities.They also seek to overthrow the Sanacja regime to end the current political deadlock.Elections The result is ..."

 poland_hof.2.d: "Early before Polish independence,the Polish Socialist Party and National Democrats were in constant conflict.The Polish Socialist Party advocated a revolution against Russian Empire,while the National Democrats saw Germany as the main threat.The trade unions under the socialists and National Workers Organization under the National Democrats also often clashed with each other.After the revolution of 1905,there were bloody conflicts between the two groups.As Polish politics worsens after the May Coup the conflict between the two fierce again.Fighting between workers has become a daily occurrence.Although the Socialist Party uses classic socialist slogans and wages many struggles for the interests of the working class,its federalism views were not popular in the Greater Poland.In contrast,the National Democrats is more attractive to Polish working class.

 poland_hof.7.d: "Wincenty Witos,a veteran of PSL who once served as the Prime Minister of Poland, announced his retirement.Witos once led part of Poland's land reform during his term as Prime Minister,but his government was overthrown in 1933 due to the May coup launched by Piłsudski,he was also sentenced guilty and imprisoned in the first Brest trial held by Piłsudski,which led to Sanacja coming to power in 1934.Since then, Witos became a staunch opponent of the Sanacja regime, has been campaigning for the democratization of Poland,and has been the leader of PSL. But as time went by, Witos decided to hand over the leadership of the party to Sona Flametail,who served as an officer in the army,younger and more energetic.\n\nFiretail himself is the leader of Pinus Sylvestris,a paramilitary organisation under People's Party.This has led to speculation that the Polish People's Party has grown tired of the peaceful approach to the struggle and that the appointment is a sign that it is beginning to draw in sympathisers in the army for military struggle.In any case,this handover has certainly increased tensions between the People's Party and the authorities at a time of growing political rivalry in Poland."

 poland_hof.8.d: "In the Sanacja regime,not everyone agrees with the increasingly heavy rule of the authorities and the further concentration of power.The second daughter of the House Nearl,Margaret Nearl's sister Maria Nearl is one of them.Recently,several generals including Maria Nearl,Władysław Eugeniusz Sikorski, Józef Haller and some leaders of the Christian Union met at residence of pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski in Morges,Switzerland,to form a reputable center-right opposition Front Morges. They want to end the authoritarian rule of the Sanacja regime and democratize Poland again.At the same time,they also hope to bring Poland closer to France.Despite the presence of such as Maria Nearl and Władysław Sikorski, Front Morges still does not have much popularity in Poland.Unless the powers-that-be in the Sanacja government reach out to them, there is not much chance of their ideas being realized."

A section of officers sympathetic to the peasants turned against goverment or refused to suppress the strike.Various peasant paramilitary organisations also began distributing weapons openly.The frustration of the government's repression had a very encouraging effect on the strikers,and many peasants who were prepared to wait chose to take up arms against the government.Some moderate senior military officers also announced their opposition to the government's decision.A civil war was inevitable."

The armoured vehicles soon broke through the roadblocks set up by the peasants,due to government's strong repressive power.The police that followed arrested the strike leaders.The troops that marched into Lublin dispersed the temporary meeting of the People's Party and part of leaders chose to go into exile.Sona Flametail resigned from her position in the army and fled before being arrested.The Pinus Sylvestris led by her,was also destroyed by the government forces.The failure of the strike did not result in the total destruction of the PSL,but the party was badly damaged.No one expects the party to win in the next elections."

 poland_hof.12.d: "The Sanacja's troops marched into the countryside to confront the striking peasants, but the army marched very slowly.Some generals refused to carry out orders,while others watched.The police were in disarray,with many of them going out without even knowing who they were going to arrest.Meanwhile,the weakness of the government kept the morale of the strikers high.In Kraków,a small group of militants seized the city hall,but the police did nothing.Most of the newspapers and media were also overwhelmingly in favor of the strikers.In this situation, the authorities could only announce the dissolution of the government and the reopening of elections.The hardline general was dismissed from his post.Two days later, Sona Flametail announced that a new government had been formed and that the People's Party had once again become the ruling party of Poland."

After Piłsudski's death, asmall groups designed by him continued to tighten their grip on the country.From the initial arrests of campaigners,election fraud,and later media censorship and political harassment,the Sanacja junta has been interfering with the campaigning of political opponents.Regardless,Sanacja's support among the Polish people was not low.The 1936 elections ended with the maintenance of the Sanacja's regime.Only time will tell whether Sanacja's rule in Poland will be as Piłsudski hoped as long as it was."

 poland_hof.15.d: "Early before Poland's independence, the National Democratic Movement(Endecja) had become the main front of Polish nationalism outside the Polish Socialist Party.Today,the leader of the National Democratic Movement,the father of Polish nationalism,Roman Dmowski's party,the Nationalist Party,won the Polish elections in 1936.During Sanacja's rule,the National Democratic Movement had been one of the regime's fiercest opponents.It is now widely speculated that the Nationalist Party's complete victory would mean the final of the Sanacja regime,or another cycle of Polish politics."

The Sanacja authorities, having been prepared for this situation,staged a military coup in a hurry.The deputies of the People's Party gathered in Warsaw and were soon captured.Sona Flametail managed to escape,but had lost control of the situation.General Edward Rydz-Śmigły declared martial law in Warsaw and Kraków and sent the police for searching for the leaders who had organized the peasant strike.\n\nWith the political power of the People's Party destroyed by a blow,there was nothing can stop General Śmigły from controlling of the country.He was soon sworn in as President of Poland and gained the support of a large number of nationalists.Even the National Democrats congratulate the new Sanacja leader rarely."

The intelligence section finally settled on Meteorite.Meteorite was one of the most famous Jewish officers in the Polish army,having joined the \"Firewatcher\" as a mercenary officer and having been granted Polish citizenship and promoted to senior officer for his service in the Polish independence and Soviet-Polish wars.Despite her service to Poland,Meteorite was also a member of the Jewish trade union organization \"Bund\" and had relatives living in the Soviet Union.In an era when Judeo–Bolshevism was in vogue, these factors undoubtedly increased suspicion of Meteorite."

After a brief questioning,Meteor was arrested on the spot.The next day,reports appeared in the newspapers describing Meteorite as a traitor,although at this point there had not been any trial proceedings. Meteorite was then transported to Brest to face trial.The courts in Brest had been used to try dissidents as early as 1934,when Piłsudski staged the May Coup.These people were arrested and imprisoned before the elections,including the leader of the People's Party, Wincenty Witos.Although the Sanacja government released them after the elections and gave some of them the opportunity to go into exile,the Brest court has become a symbol of the repression of dissidents in the country.Only,this time it was not the dissidents who were on trial,but the senior officer Meteorite who was accused of being a traitor."

After carefully examining the evidence provided by Czarny,Firewatch found many places that did not match her experience,but her heart kept calling her to seize this opportunity to find the traitor. Perhaps the thirst for revenge will overwhelm her rationality."

Margaret Nearl raised severe objections, but the forest guard still responded clearly in a very flat tone. During the trial, Meteor's attitude was once gentle and sincere, but after listening to the speech of the forest guard, his emotions suddenly collapsed, and he kept sobbing in court, no longer answering the questions of the judge and the inspector.

Naturally, the radicals of the Nationalist Party did not miss this opportunity to attack the nationalist policy of Biesławski and the rule of the Sanač authorities. At the instigation of Bolesław Piasecki, the leader of the young radical wing of the Nationalist Party, a group of Nationalist Party radicals started a riot in Warsaw.\n\nAt first, the riot was only a protest to \"cleanse\" the government and the army of Jews. Soon the \"protests\" turned into slogans calling for the ouster of the Sanacja government, and some tried to storm the State Sejm, which was heavily guarded by the Roayl Castle and out of the riot's reach.

Now,in order to gain more advantages in the upcoming elections,the Sanacja needs to put forward a leader to shore up the facade. \n\nOne choice is Ioleta Russell, who is well known on all sides of Polish politics.Russell was one of the most successful of the military generals-turned-politicians from the Polish Legion era.She has had considerable influence in Polish politics, the military and the general public. However, Russell has repeatedly expressed her displeasure with the political methods of the Sanacja authorities since the Brest trials,fought for Vincenti Vítos and has become a sympathiser of the Polish People's Party.\n\nAnother option was Młynar Nearl.As the elder of the Nearl,he became famous at the Battle of Warsaw during the Polish-Soviet War and became the war hero most admired by Piłsudski.However,the problems of the Polish Republic caused he to become disillusioned and cynical. Electing Młynar Nearl as president might have gained much support, but it's afraid that he had no interest in defending the Sanacja regime. \n\nThe last option was McKee.As a spokesman for the business community, McKee's keenness to defend the interests of Polish capitalists without contradicting the Sanacja political principles made him unpopular in the army. However, his loyalty to the Sanacja and his flexible political manoeuvres made him one of the few businessmen to reach the top echelons of Sanacja's administration. Due to a lack of contact with the general public, many people do not know who McKee is.Choicing of him as president could affect Sanacja's popularity within the general public."

They dragged the goods from the Jewish shops to the marketplace to be burned and prepared to set fire to the synagogue. \n\nTheir leader was Adam Doboszyński, a prominent national-democratic activist. A well-known nationalist writer, Doboszyński had been active in the national democrats for ten years, advocating an organic Catholic society and hating both liberal capitalism and socialism. He gave lectures on nationalism to workers and opened mobile libraries in the countryside to disseminate the party's publications. \n\nNow we can leave this to the local police, but the effects of this will be unpredictable. It has been suggested that the army should be mobilised to suppress the mobs and take the opportunity to sweep up and fight the right-wing militias.

But as industrialization gradually took place, some peasants chose to sell their land and become employees of state-owned or private enterprises in the city, becoming Poland's growing proletariat. The development of industry also allowed for the production of a great deal of agricultural machinery, which gradually alleviated the problem of inefficient agricultural production.

Although he considered himself a Marxist, he only saw collectivization in agrarian socialism as a tool to counter the inefficiencies of the smallholder economy. In his view, Poland should have a mixed system of voluntary collectivization and private ownership of land. \n\nLimanowski's pragmatism provided an effective guideline for the Polish Socialist Party's agrarian policy.

Information from workers' intelligence agents indicated that a Nationalist figure codenamed \"Platinum\" was attempting to organise the assassination of Maria Nearl and Sikorski, among others. It is likely that General Rydz-Śmigły was also aware of this. \n\nThis information was very important to the Socialist Party.
