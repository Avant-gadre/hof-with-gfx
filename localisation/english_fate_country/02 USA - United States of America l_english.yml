The M18 Recoilless Rifle has an effective range of 400 yards, a maximum range of nearly 5,000 yards, and is more accurate compared with the old M2.

 USA_night_vision2_short: "M3 Sniperscope"
 USA_night_vision2_desc: "In response to the poor reception of the M1 Sniperscope, the Sniperscope M3 was adopted. With almost twice the effective range of the M1, a more robust infrared light source, and the T23 flash hider, the M3 is a vast improvement over its predecessor, though some soldiers complain of the light source bleeding into the visible spectrum and thus giving away their position."

 USA_motorized_equipment_1_short: "ACKW"
 USA_motorized_equipment_1_desc: "The ACKW, officially the '1936 Conventional cab All-wheel drive Dual rear axles', commonly known as the 'Jimmy' or 'Deuce and a Half', is 2 and 1/2-ton load-rated 6x6 off-road capable tactical truck. Developed by the General Motors Company at the redquest of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in 1935, the ACKW comes in many variants, including open or closed cab and long or short wheel base models. The ACKW quickly became the U.S. army's standard truck and displayed great potential in logistical operations."

 USA_mechanized_equipment_1_short: "M2 Carrier"
 USA_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "The M2 Carrier, also refferred to as the 'American Carrier', is based on the design of the Canadian Universal Carrier imported in the 1930s. Constructed by Willys-Overland Motor Company and modified to make use of largely Jeep automotive components, the M2 Carrier has better hill-climbing capabilities than Canadian carriers, but suffers from reliability issues."

 USA_mechanized_equipment_2_desc: "The continuous development of carriers in the U.S. led to the appearance of the M4 Carrier. Built by Studebaker and developed with newest Canadian designs in mind, the M4 is an all-weather carrier designed as a basic chassis for many specialised roles, including a model for amphibious operations. With the ability to carry 6 soldiers, the M4 is in that regard more capable than its predecessor, but suffers from reliability issues without proper maintenance."

Though the M9's top speed is a bit lower than the M4's, the M9 can carry more soldiers and is far more reliable. With enough space for auxiliary bits of infantry kit and thick armour, the M9 is a capable personal carrier."

It is commonly known as 'Xylophone' and is a model developed to fix the bad accuracy of the M12 by adding to it an additional rocket launcher. Whilst still being not very useful according to soldiers, the M14 showed itself effective during test trials and was accepted as the standard mobile rocket launcher of the U.S. army."

They, of course, evolved into highly capable assault troop and fire support vehicles. Developed by Donald Roebling in 1935, the civilian rescue vehicle "Alligator" was later developed into the LVT-1, which lacked armour protection and was unreliable when used on hard terrain. The LVT-2 built upon the LVT-1, with that vehicles most glaring problems fixed."
