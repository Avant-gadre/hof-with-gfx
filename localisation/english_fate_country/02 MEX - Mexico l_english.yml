 MEX_focus_new_american_myth: "New American Myth"
 MEX_focus_new_american_myth_desc: "We have been at the edge of the world stage for too long time. But now, under the leadership of Quetzalcoatl, we will create our own myth in the new age."
 MEX_focus_repeal_the_calles_law: "Repeal the Calles Law"
 MEX_focus_repeal_the_calles_law_desc: "Calles incited the Cristeros to revolt by heavy-handed application of the anti-religious articles of the Constitution. The Calles Law humiliates the clergy by forbidding the wearing of clerical garb in public and imprisonment for religious figures who criticize the government. We agree that the Church's political influence needs curtailing but these are attacks on individual liberty, not Church power."
 MEX_focus_plan_of_agua_prieta: "Plan of Agua Prieta"
 MEX_focus_plan_of_agua_prieta_desc: "The Revolution against Díaz and the vicious infighting afterwards lasted a decade. When the dust was settled, the victorious Northern generals met at Agua Prieta, Sonora, to lay out their plan for Mexico's future. They are a populist clique of modernizers and secularizers, or else a 'confederation of caciques' little better than bandit lords dividing their spoils, depending upon one's perspective."
 MEX_mexicaytol: "Rise of the Mexicayotl Movement"
 MEX_mexicaytol_desc: "Rallying around the ideas, art, and word of Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón, the Mexicayotl Movement has risen to save the Nahua culture from the perversions of Carrasco and his Ethnonationalist vermin. Seeking to hijack his indigenous revivalism movement and take it in a direction rooted in egalitarian Socialism and democratic communalism, Kahlo and the Triple Alliance Elite shall work tirelessly to save Mexico from the caustic ideology of the ARM while embracing our Indigenous history over our Imperialist-tainted reality."
 MEX_focus_proclaim_aztec: "Proclaim the Aztec Empire"
 MEX_focus_proclaim_aztec_desc: "It has been four hundred years since invaders destroyed our country. Though today many people of our nation is the descandant of Europeans, we have gathered together under a new culture, and a new nation. The new blood is in everyone's body. Now it is time to raise the flag of our lost empire, and to reclaim our inherent rights."

 MEX_focus_nahui_ehecatl_desc: "In our chronicles there has been five suns. Though modern science has revealed the structure of solar system, we have obtained the ability to create our own sun. Let Quetzalcoatl, the lord of the second solar period, to bring the fury of the sun to the ground."
 MEX_rebuild_lost_empire: "Rebuilding the Lost Empire"
 MEX_rebuild_lost_empire_desc: "The Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān, or Triple Alliance, was the greatest civilization the New World ever saw. Excelling at war, science, civic planning and administration, and agriculture, and growing to become the dominant culture and religious force of their region, the original Triple Alliance is truly something to envy and awe. Though the vile copy created by Carrasco has been cast down, that does not mean that we should stop trying to return to these former glories. We shall rebuild the once-great empire of the Mexica, incorporating ideas from the Olmecs and the Toltecs, as well as from our own Socialist influences in order to rebuild and surpass the glories, culture, and industrial and economic might lost all those centuries ago when the Conquistador first reached shore."
 MEX_recreate_kalpulli: "Recreate the Kalpulli Communities"
 MEX_recreate_kalpulli_desc: "The Kalpulli were native communes and communities that worked in a sort of proto-feudalist and proto-communalist system, providing food, manpower, sacrifices, and other supplies for the Toltec and Aztec empires, along with other Mesoamerican communities, while the main city-states, or altepetl, oversaw the production and administration of urban goods and services. We shall work to modernize and incorporate this system of Kalpulli communes working in unison with Altepetl urban centers, creating an efficient, egalitarian, and anti-authoriaian system of societal organization where each settlement and commune specializes and works in tandem with their constituent parts - a true Socialist and semi-Anarchist system invented centuries before the writings and theories of Marx realized once more."
 MEX_modern_agrarianism: "Archaic Agrarianism Made Modern"
 MEX_modern_agrarianism_desc: "Tweaking the long-standing Ejido system to fit the needs of the People, we shall move to usher in a new agricultural revolution in Mexico. Mechanization and modernization shall be the name of the game as we try to bail Mexico out of the Dark Ages and into the contemporary age. By modernizing the agricultural practices of our ancestors, such as the Chiampa system, and pairing it with new technological advances, we shall build an agrarian economy to be the envy of all other Agrarian regimes around the world."
 MEX_mexican_values: "Indigenous Culture and Mexican Values"
 MEX_mexican_values_desc: "As we progress towards this new conception of indigenous values and culture, we should be careful to never forget the history and odyssey that brought us to our current realities. Though we are native at heat, Spanish imperialism and European colonization still runs hot in our blood and in our history. Instead of burying this past and pretending it never happened, we shall move to reconcile the damage and benefits this unique path has brought us as we work to fuse our Mexican and European-borne reality with our Indigneous history."
 MEX_lost_languages: "Reviving Our Lost Languages"
 MEX_lost_languages_desc: "The Uto-Aztekan language group describes the multitude of languages used by both the citizens of the Aztec Empire and the wider nations, clans, tribes, and other human settlements around them. Stretching from the American Southwest to northern Central America, this language family is as diverse as it is ancient. We shall move to revive all the languages of this ethnolinguistic family, particularly among the Nahautl subgroup. Though it will take many, many years and tons of effort, we shall slowly work to replace the dominance of Spanish-borne Mexican with the indiegnous tongues of the People."
 MEX_aztec_elite: "The Aztec Triple Alliance Elite"
 MEX_aztec_elite_desc: "The group of artists, intellectuals, and philosophers that truly rule the nation behind the unifying visage of the Great Tōltēcātl and Tecuichpoch Frida Kahlo are named the Aztec Triple Alliance Elite. So named after the original Aztec Empire’s true name, this cabal of thinkers, cultural titans, and revolutionary heroes are the true governing and administrative force behind the new regime. By their will and by their secretive word, the new Mexicayotl Movement and the new Mexico bends to their whim, and with the nationally beloved Kahlo as the face of this clique, none shall stand it our way as we progress Mexican society away from the preposterous lunacy of Carrasco and the ARM and towards the light of Indigenous Socialism."
 MEX_house_of_sun: "Praise the House of the Sun"
 MEX_house_of_sun_desc: "The House of the Sun, also called the In Kaltonal, is the Nahautl term for the Native Mexican Church, and describes the sun worship typical in the religion. With the religion spreading throughout Mexico quite rapidly due to it appeasing both the Christian and Indigenous halves of our society, we shall go ahead and name this new faith the state religion of Mexico. All the old folk saints and Vatican-ordained saints shall be transferred over to this new faith, given traditional names, and paired to similar Aztec and Toltec deities. We will build a new religion accepted by all and dominant throughout all Mexico in order to unite the people and the culture like never before."
 MEX_conserve_native_church: "Consecrate the Native Mexican Church"
 MEX_conserve_native_church_desc: "The Native Mexican Church is the proposed spiritual body that seeks to combine certain Christian ideas and practices with the faith and culture of the indigenous Nahuatl peoples. First formed as a confederation of multiple Kalpulli, or Socialist communes echoing indegenous cultural practices, and now stands as the most rapidly growing religion in Mexico. We shall move to officially support this new syncretic faith and help it to spread throughout Mexico in hopes that we can amend the difference between our two distinct cultural halves."
 MEX_revitalize_culture: "Revitalize the Anahuac Culture"
 MEX_revitalize_culture_desc: "Anahuac, meaning close to water in Nahuatl, was used by the Aztecs to describe the ancient core of Mexico, and can roughly be described as the spiritual water realm and underground aquifers and valley springs around Mexico City, where Tenochtitlan once stood. We shall move to revitalize and spread the Anahuac culture, or the modernist, Socialist, and indigenously-rooted culture of Mexico City to the wider nation, creating a cosmopolitan Amerindian culture for all Mexicans to embrace and cherish."
 MEX_neo_shamanism: "The Nahua Neo-Shamanist Renaissance"
 MEX_neo_shamanism_desc: "Atzec and wider Mexica and Nahua culture had a compex priesthood, with priests named after and dedicated to each of the patron gods of the Aztec and Toltec pantheons, their own sacrificial calendar separated from the traditional chronological calendar, and multitudes of different holidays, feast days, and other periods of ceremonial significance. We shall move to revive these traditions and practices in a modernized form of Neo-Shamanism. Unlike the direct revival of Carrasco and the ARM, we shall pursue a moderated, humanized, and modernized form of the once barbaric religion of the Aztecs, incorporating those ideas which will make us stronger, and ditching the practices that would only alienate us from the rest of the world."
 MEX_word_tecuichpoch: "Undeniable Word of Tecuichpoch"
 MEX_word_tecuichpoch_desc: "Tecuichpoch Ichacaxochitizin was known as the Last Aztec Empress, and served as the consort and aid to numerous Aztec Tlatoanis, including the great Cuauhtemoc, final Emperor of the Aztecs. Of royal blood as the daughter of Moctezuma II, Tecuichpoch was one of the greatest and most revered Mexica to ever live. Honoring this history, we have moved to grant Frida Kahlo with the honorific of Tecuichpoch II, solidifying her great importance to the state and placing her on the pedestal of power alongside Emperors, Empresses, and Gods as the rest of the Triple Alliance Elite work to implement our Socialist dream.Tecuichpoch’s word shall be law, undeniable and unignorable, and by her genius, we will thrive like never before."
 MEX_hail_toltecatl: "All Hail the Great Tōltēcātl"
 MEX_hail_toltecatl_desc: "The Tōltēcātl, or Toltecayotl, is a Nahua word that refers to the members of the long-dead Toltec civilization, though has gained wider usage as referring to any skilled indigenous artisan. Frida Kahlo is beloved and renowned as the Great Tōltēcātl - the greatest artisan of our people and the muse of millions. By her artistic and cultural genius, we are guided to salvation and the revival of our slumbering idigneous identity, and by her will, we are brought to salvation from the villains of the ARM. Though her illnesses keep her body confined, her mind and genius is only fed by these obstacles, and this only fuels her to greater heights of artistic and cultural ingenuity. With her at the helm, our culture will flourish like never before!"
 MEX_focus_party_of_the_revolution: "Party of the Revolution"
 MEX_focus_party_of_the_revolution_desc: "President Cárdenas was elected on a platform of agrarian reform thanks to the support of worker and peasant organizations. We have implemented the reforms and now have a proud socialist nation ready to fight injustice on the international stage."

 MEX_focus_exile_calles_desc: "The former president Plutarco Calles served his term between 1924 and 1928. His misrule incited the Cristero War and countless minor rebellions. Now he seeks to dominate President Cárdenas as he controlled the last few puppet presidents. Cárdenas has his own democratic mandate, his own plan for the future, and Calles needs to leave for the sake of the stability of Mexico."
 MEX_focus_jefe_maximo: "Jefe Máximo"
 MEX_focus_jefe_maximo_desc: "Mexico will descend even deeper into chaos if Plutarco Calles loses his influence over the country. He created the administrations of Portes, Ortiz, Rodríguez and now Cárdenas, and his political enemies castigate him as 'el Jefe Maximo', like some bandit chieftain! In truth, Calles is simply an elderly statesman with only the best intentions for Mexico in mind. Losing him at this stage of the Revolution would be a travesty."
 MEX_focus_ban_catholic: "Suppress Catholicism"
 MEX_focus_ban_catholic_desc: "Catholicism refuse to recognize Quetzalcoatl as the deity of the Mesoamerica, which will be no more tolerated. We must secure the leadership of Quetzalcoatl at any cost."

 MEX_focus_enforce_the_calles_law_desc: "The Cristero footsoldiers may not have been destroyed in the field, but in the years following their futile rebellion we hunted down their remaining leaders and sympathizers within the Church, decapitating their movement and ensuring no resurgence. The Church has no choice but to accept our demands against them. They will become another instrument of the state's power or we will continue decapitating them."
 MEX_focus_triumph_over_the_cristeros: "Triumph over the Cristeros"
 MEX_focus_triumph_over_the_cristeros_desc: "Many talented individuals rose to the top during the anti-Cristero campaigns. Fighting insurgents with small unit tactics and aerial support gave our generals an excellent opportunity to test their abilities. The repression campaign also let us see who had the stomach for messier work."
 MEX_focus_state_education: "State Education"
 MEX_focus_state_education_desc: "Socialist education in Mexico means a focus on rationalism and patriotism, rather than adherence to the Pope's dogmas and diktats.

People will not tolerate the parasitic clergy when they know that a different world is possible."

 MEX_jaguar_warriors: "Jaguar Warriors"
 MEX_jaguar_warriors_desc: "Another rank of Aztec fighter was the Jaguar Warrior, who was more heavily armed and armored than the Eagle Warrior.

 MEX_eagle_warriors: "Eagle Warriors"
 MEX_eagle_warriors_desc: "The Aztecs prized fighting skills, and soldiers earned increased status in society through distinction in combat and promotion in rank.

 MEX_focus_rewrite_the_constitution: "Rewrite the Constitution of 1917"
 MEX_focus_rewrite_the_constitution_desc: "The Constitution written by the vicious generals places the state above the Church, making marriage a civil act, preventing the clergy from endorsing political candidates, and refusing to recognise the Catholic Church as the source of moral authority in Mexico.

 MEX_focus_reform_the_cristero_guard_desc: "The Cristeros valiantly defended the Church from the oppression of Calles the tyrant and a lot of them died as martyrs under the banner of Christ.

 MEX_focus_national_spirit_desc: "It is a time of change. Without promoting our national spirit, we cannot make sure people could united under the threat from outside. It is not just propaganda, it is the voice of everyone."

 MEX_focus_spanish_civil_war_refugees_desc: "The conflagration gripping Spain is displacing tens of thousands of Spanish citizens. Many of them are the creme of the Spanish intelligentsia, or otherwise highly skilled technical personnel. By granting them refuge we will be fulfilling our humanitarian duties and benefitting Mexico at the same time."

 MEX_focus_invite_brazil: "Invite Brazil"
 MEX_focus_invite_brazil_desc: "Although, as a former Portuguese colony, Brazil's history doesn't perfectly mirror Mexico's, they are still culturally closer to ourselves than to vengeful European imperialists or greedy Yanqui businessmen. We should bring them closer to our sphere in order to benefit from mutual protection."
 MEX_focus_goddess_wisdom: "Good God's Wisdom"

 MEX_focus_liberate_the_caribbean: "Liberate the Caribbean"
 MEX_focus_liberate_the_caribbean_desc: "Like the rest of Latin America, the Caribbean states were ruthlessly exploited by European imperialists before throwing off their shackles. Though still weak, these states deserve our protecction. Mexico's national pride demands that we secure the Caribbean to prevent its exploitation by imperialists!"
 MEX_focus_liberate_the_antilles: "Liberate the Antilles"
 MEX_focus_liberate_the_antilles_desc: "Many Caribbean islands are still occupied by imperialist powers who continue their oppressive exploitation that has been continuous since the discovery of the Americas. We will end the injustice of colonialism for all time!"
 MEX_focus_integrate_the_caribbean: "Integrate the Caribbean"
 MEX_focus_integrate_the_caribbean_desc: "The petty republics of the Caribbean are being absorbed into the Mexican state, and now it is the turn of the peoples of the Caribbean. They will become loyal Mexican citizens as they uphold our traditions and in turn receive the benefits of being part of the community of the Mexican nation."
 MEX_focus_unify_centroamerica: "Unify Centroamérica"
 MEX_focus_unify_centroamerica_desc: "The petty banana republics of Nicaragua, Panamá and Costa Rica are too small to be viable countries. We must absorb them into our own nation and thereby bring glory to Mexico and the Mexican people."

 MEX_focus_integrate_the_south: "Integrate the South"
 MEX_focus_integrate_the_south_desc: "The unity of the peoples of Mexico has been a slow process, but it will not stop at regional borders or mountain ranges. We have surmounted such obstacles in the past and we will do so again for the Southern provinces."
 MEX_focus_march_southwards: "March Southwards"
 MEX_focus_march_southwards_desc: "Mexico lost the provinces to her south after the independence struggle. The incompetent Mexican Empire was a blight on our history, but we can rectify its mistakes. The Southern states are critical to our defense and we will reclaim them."
 MEX_focus_seize_the_panama_canal: "Seize the Panamá Canal"
 MEX_focus_seize_the_panama_canal_desc: "One of the most critical chokepoints in the world, this canal was dug at great cost to the Latino workers who bled and died under American whips for the profit of the industrialists. Having captured the surrounding terrain, we can launch a lightning strike on the small canal garrison, forcing the Yanquis to choose between waging a bloody war against us or turning over control of the canal."
 MEX_focus_fortify_the_canal: "Fortify the Canal"

 MEX_focus_redeem_aztlan_desc: "The Mexican people living in the liberated regions of the United States have a dream of a government which does not oppress them for their ancestry, place of birth or the language they speak at home. That dream has become a reality."
 MEX_focus_atlantic_fleet: "Extent the voyage"
 MEX_focus_atlantic_fleet_desc: "We do not have any naval base on the overseas island, which means that we need to extent the ship voyage to reach Europe immediately."

 MEX_focus_rescind_the_mexican_cession: "Rescind the Mexican Cession"
 MEX_focus_rescind_the_mexican_cession_desc: "The vast lands lost to our Northern aggressor in 1848 continue to tantalize some Mexican nationalists. There are now millions of Hispanic people living in the United States, some descendents of original Mexican inhabitants, others more recent migrants. We should redeem the honor of Mexico by smashing the Yanqui aggressors and uniting the Mexican people!"
 MEX_focus_national_bank: "National Bank"
 MEX_focus_national_bank_desc: "Formed in 1925 to rebuild an economy shattered by civil war, Banco de México is our lender of last resort, issuer of currency, and investor in all manner of ventures for the interest of the state."
 MEX_focus_northern_steel_plants: "Northern Steel Plants"
 MEX_focus_northern_steel_plants_desc: "The most industrialized region in Mexico outside the capital is the northern border with America. Cities along the Rio Grande such as Matamoros and Ciudad Juarez enjoy close economic ties to their counterparts over the border like Brownsville and El Paso. We should exploit the superior infrastructure in the area to further develop our heavy industries."
 MEX_focus_law_on_industrial_promotion: "Law on Industrial Promotion"
 MEX_focus_law_on_industrial_promotion_desc: "For many years, the Mexican states and federal government have sought to encourage development of new industries via tax exemptions. Oftentimes, the local regulations work against national interests by diverting capital to unimportant or inefficient areas. We need to rationalize our approach to industrial development with a centralized plan."
 MEX_focus_engineering_school: "Engineering School"
 MEX_focus_engineering_school_desc: "Part of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City, the Escuela Superior de Ingenería Mecánica y Eléctrica is training a new generation of pioneers in mechanical and electronic engineering."
 MEX_focus_television_innovators: "Television Innovators"
 MEX_focus_television_innovators_desc: "Mexico has a surprisingly advanced electronics industry. Guillermo González Camarena and other members of the 'League of Radio Experiments' are experimenting with color television transmissions. We could become world leaders in communications technology if we focus on these developments."
 MEX_focus_oil_field_expansion: "Oil Field Expansion"
 MEX_focus_oil_field_expansion_desc: "America's need for oil is insatiable. Even though they produce a majority of oil in the world, they import the resource as well. Mexico has undeveloped oil fields up and down the Gulf Coast which we can tap into for exports."
 MEX_focus_royal_dutch_shell: "Royal Dutch Shell"
 MEX_focus_royal_dutch_shell_desc: "Royal Dutch Shell is a British and Dutch firm holding 60% of Mexican oil concessions. By compromising with the foreign oil companies on the matter of labor disputes, we can come to an accomodation that is beneficial to us both."
 MEX_focus_oil_revenue_reinvestment: "Oil Revenue Reinvestment"
 MEX_focus_oil_revenue_reinvestment_desc: "As we now benefit more from the selling of oil, our budget has quickly increased and we must plan on a useful way to use those new funds. In order to benefit from it in the long run, a reinvestment of those revenues into economic stimulation seems to be the most obvious choice."
 MEX_focus_nationalize_the_oil_fields: "Nationalize the Oil Fields"
 MEX_focus_nationalize_the_oil_fields_desc: "The foreign oil concessions are dominating the Mexican economy and exerting too much influence over our affairs, both domestic and foreign. The British and Americans pay more attention to Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil than to our government!"
 MEX_focus_capital_reserves: "Capital Reserves"
 MEX_focus_capital_reserves_desc: "The hard cash we raise selling oil is allowing us to flex our economic muscles. If we need to buy technology from America or Britain, for example, we now have the means. We can reverse engineer or mass produce these designs as we see fit."
 MEX_focus_community_of_nations: "Community of Nations"
 MEX_focus_community_of_nations_desc: "Our economic dependence on British trade need not be a curse. By accepting the status quo we can engage in international diplomacy with the backing of a super power."
 MEX_focus_purchase_belize: "Purchase Belize"
 MEX_focus_purchase_belize_desc: "This small territory was long claimed by the Spanish crown in colonial times, though never settled by peninsulares. After the loss of Spain's colonial empire during the Napoleonic Wars, Britain gradually solidifed a hold on the territory, culminating in the creation of the colony of British Honduras in 1862. The territory ought to be turned over to Mexico as a gesture of good faith."
 MEX_focus_oppose_yanqui_imperialism: "Oppose Yanqui Imperialism"
 MEX_focus_oppose_yanqui_imperialism_desc: "Having rightfully reclaimed the natural resources of our country, the foreigners are now clamoring for compensation, but the concessions were essentially stolen from the Mexican people in their time of weakness under the dictator Díaz. Why should we pay a thief for returning stolen property?"
 MEX_focus_new_world_order: "New World Order"
 MEX_focus_new_world_order_desc: "The Germans are clearly the masters of Europe. We will surely have a place in their New World Order if we help them against the British and Americans. The old Zimmermann Telegram was sent for a reason: America can only be destroyed by a land invasion..."
 MEX_focus_german_resource_exchange: "German Resource Exchange"
 MEX_focus_german_resource_exchange_desc: "The German war machine is gearing back up and needs Mexican oil to function properly. Rather than prostrate ourselves before the Americans or sell our country to the Russians, we can try to exploit the German need for oil to improve our military power."
 MEX_focus_international_proletarianism: "International Proletarianism"
 MEX_focus_international_proletarianism_desc: "The Soviets have demonstrated that their socialism will transform the planet. The Revolution we fought so hard for was only one step on the road to liberating the people: first of Mexico, and now of the entire world."
 MEX_focus_ejido_worker_militias: "Ejido Worker Militias"
 MEX_focus_ejido_worker_militias_desc: "The land reform promised in the Constitution of 1917 has seen slow progress. Often, landlords use thugs and private armies to intimidate their tenants to prevent redistribution. Let us organize the peasants, farmers and laborers into communal militias to protect the gains we are making against injustice."
 MEX_focus_compensation: "Compensation"
 MEX_focus_compensation_desc: "The oil concessions were legally sold to Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil. We cannot fault the foreign firms for seeking a profit. We should maintain the integrity of our legal system by compensating the foreigners for nationalizing the concessions."
 MEX_focus_liberty_and_justice_for_all: "Liberty and Justice For All"
 MEX_focus_liberty_and_justice_for_all_desc: "The Americans are now the greatest economic power in history. The Soviets may be fast industrializing, and the Germans may understand war better, but America's advantages are complimented by her insistence upon freedom for the individual and reliance on institutions over brute force. Extending our economic ties to a military alliance would only be natural."
 MEX_focus_aztec_eagles: "Aztec Eagles"
 MEX_focus_aztec_eagles_desc: "We are one of Latin America's most influential nations. We should demonstrate our commitment to the security of the world by aiding America in her struggles against foreign warmongers who threaten the general peace with their expansionism."

 MEX_focus_international_peacekeepers_desc: "The democratic powers of the world plan to create an alliance of equals, a United Nations, to ensure international security by giving the countries of the world a place to reconcile their differences and arbitrate disputes. We will throw ourselves into such a project to help the Latin American nations maintain their independence."
 MEX_focus_agricultural_credit_bank: "Agricultural Credit Bank"
 MEX_focus_agricultural_credit_bank_desc: "The Banco de Crédito Agricola will help speed up the land reform program by giving loans to ejido farmers with which to buy machinery and other capital goods.

 MEX_focus_confederation_of_mexican_workers: "Confederation of Mexican Workers"
 MEX_focus_confederation_of_mexican_workers_desc: "The political elite in Mexico have alway sought to control trades union activities. The CTM will replace the CROM, as the latter is seen as corrupt and discredited by association with unpopular past leaders of the regime."
 MEX_focus_rent_freeze: "Rent Freeze"
 MEX_focus_rent_freeze_desc: "The urban laborers are a key constituent in the new Mexico we are building. They were mobilized into Red Battalions during the Revolution and now seek the compensation they were promised. One area of immediate concern should be the parasitic landlords extracting rents from these hardworking wealth creators."
 MEX_focus_rural_schools: "Rural Schools"
 MEX_focus_rural_schools_desc: "The schools are where we turn the raw material of illiterate peasants into patriotic citizens willing to fight injustice and strengthen the Fatherland. The Escuelas Regionales Campesinas will revolutionize the peasants, teach them technical skills and make them self-reliant."
 MEX_focus_rural_infrastructure: "Rural Infrastructure"
 MEX_focus_rural_infrastructure_desc: "The rail systems in Mexico were expanded during the Díaz era, but concentrated mostly in the Northern cities so as to facilitate trade with America. We should push the railways further south."
 MEX_focus_peripheral_infrastructure: "Peripheral Infrastructure"
 MEX_focus_peripheral_infrastructure_desc: "Our most rural regions have seen little improvement in their infrastructure for decades. There are swathes of poverty-stricken subsistence farmers who would become open to factory work and education if we expanded our road systems."
 MEX_focus_urban_development: "Urban Development"
 MEX_focus_urban_development_desc: "The cities are the center of economic activity and therefore must have their needs prioritized over the backwards rural states. We will build up the road and rail systems in Mexico City and the other major urban areas, and in doing so the wealth of Mexico will increase even more."
 MEX_focus_liberalize_the_banking_sector: "Liberalize the Banking Sector"
 MEX_focus_liberalize_the_banking_sector_desc: "There are many heavy-handed government policies preventing the market from transforming Mexico. The 1925 General Law of Credit Institutions, for example, prevents banks from owning shares in other banks. Ridiculous! The freer the market, the freer the people. Luis Montes de Oca, an advocate of the Austrian School of Economics, will help us reform the banking system."
 MEX_focus_cientifico_camarilla: "Científico Camarilla"
 MEX_focus_cientifico_camarilla_desc: "The Díaz regime was supported by a clique of technocrats in the cabinet and private business. The unpopular clientelism and patronage systems they established were one reason the regime collapsed. However, we have the love and support of the people, and the Científicos have some much needed skills..."
 MEX_focus_strike_breaking: "Strike Breaking"
 MEX_focus_strike_breaking_desc: "Unionization is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution of 1917, but attacks on property are criminal and should be treated as such. Withdrawing labor from a critical industry could even be perceived as treasonous in a time of crisis."
 MEX_focus_purge_the_bureaucracy: "Purge the Bureaucracy"
 MEX_focus_purge_the_bureaucracy_desc: "The Callistas are being removed from their unearned positions of influence. We have many suitable replacements in mind, men of ability and intelligence who will be grateful for the opportunity to serve Mexico..."
 MEX_focus_nafinsa: "NAFINSA"
 MEX_focus_nafinsa_desc: "Nacional Financiera is a development bank established to encourage the industrialization of Mexico. It has been especially important in the creation of new factories in the central Mexican states, such as chemical plants and metalworks in Mexico City."
 MEX_focus_end_land_reform: "End Land Reform"
 MEX_focus_end_land_reform_desc: "The land reform program has long been abused by local strongmen with political connections or military power. A wealthy farmer stealing public land for his own gain doesn't help make Mexico stronger or more united. That land should instead be sold to the highest bidder. Perhaps some landlords do abuse their tenants, but that is a matter for the courts."
 MEX_focus_privatization: "Privatization"
 MEX_focus_privatization_desc: "The ejido system places restrictions on the use of land, depending upon the use intended by the government. Why should the state force farmers into subsistence rather than growing cash crops for export? We can make Mexico wealthier if we break up the communal farms and allow real development to take place. Antiquated notions of self-reliance only stand in the way of progress and globalization."
 MEX_focus_abolish_capital_punishment: "Abolish Capital Punishment"
 MEX_focus_abolish_capital_punishment_desc: "The recent instabilities of military rebellion, peasant revolt and the Cristero War, and the government's bloody response to these and to pettier 'crimes', have resulted in an atmosphere of fear pervading Mexico. People can no longer talk freely for fear of being tyrannized by the state. We should phase out capital punishment. By loosening our grip, people will no longer feel compelled to escape it."
 MEX_focus_xefo: "XEFO"
 MEX_focus_xefo_desc: "The government has been building radio masts and setting up stations all over the country. It is useful for disseminating propaganda but it also brings rural people into closer contact with one another. XEFO is one such radio station that is run by the Partido Nacional Revolucionario."
 MEX_focus_national_agriculture: "National Agriculture Alliance"
 MEX_focus_national_agriculture_desc: "Agiculture is the basis of national economy. Those separated and poor farmers should be organized and guided by our government."
 MEX_army_modernization: "Modernize the Ejército Mexicano"
 MEX_army_modernization_desc: "The Mexican armed forces are still using outdated equipment from the Weltkrieg-era, and our military doctrines and tactics have also fallen behind the times over the past decade. We have to move forward from the Revolution if we are to project our influence over the Americas once more. Our nation is a major player in North and Central America economically and diplomatically, so our army must be able to back up our words."

 MEX_air_war_plans_division: "Air War Plans Division"
 MEX_air_war_plans_division_desc: "To make the right priorities in aviation as well as aircraft production will require long-term planning. The AWPD will ensure we have materiel, organization and strategic plans."
 MEX_focus_aviation_workshops: "Aviation Workshops"
 MEX_focus_aviation_workshops_desc: "The TNCA was mothballed for lack of funds after the Revolution, but with the killing power of aircraft only increasing since then we must stay on top of aeronautical advances."
 MEX_focus_military_aviation_specialists: "Military Aviation Specialists"
 MEX_focus_military_aviation_specialists_desc: "The Escuela Militar de Mecánicos Especialistas de Aviación will train a corps of skilled technical staff to service our aircraft. The better maintained the aircraft, the longer the pilots have in the air to accrue experience."

 MEX_escort_fighters_desc: "While the bomber might always get through, his wingman might not - unless they are both protected by friendly fighters."
 MEX_strategic_bombing: "Strategic Bombing"
 MEX_strategic_bombing_desc: "The capacity to execute precision bombing will allow us to stop the war machine of any nation in its tracks."

 MEX_air_support_desc: "Aerial warfare must first and foremost be used in conjunction with other military operations."
 MEX_close_air_bombers: "Close Air Bombers"
 MEX_close_air_bombers_desc: "The value of using dive bombers for close air support should not be underestimated."
 MEX_tactical_bombers: "Tactical Bombers"
 MEX_tactical_bombers_desc: "The era is past when armies could win wars without looking to the skies. We must develop our tactical bombers to provide our soldiers with the air support they need."
 MEX_focus_military_budget_review: "Military Budget Review"
 MEX_focus_military_budget_review_desc: "The well funded military of the Díaz regime crumbled when Revolutionary militias began liberating cities and cutting them off from funding. Let us review the finances of the military to ensure its longevity in times of war."
 MEX_two_ocean_navy: "Two Ocean Navy"
 MEX_two_ocean_navy_desc: "With war on the horizon, we must ensure that no enemy can ever set foot on American shores. Our navy must be able to fight any enemy in either of the two great oceans that form our borders."
 MEX_focus_pacific_coast_naval_yards: "Pacific Coast Naval Yards"
 MEX_focus_pacific_coast_naval_yards_desc: "Trade over the Pacific with Japan and California is less important to us than the Atlantic, but we should protect our interests and open up more possibilities. Expanding the Pacific shipyards gives us that much more leeway if the Gulf should become blockaded."
 MEX_focus_gulf_coast_naval_yards: "Gulf Coast Naval Yards"
 MEX_focus_gulf_coast_naval_yards_desc: "Our Gulf Coast faces Europe and the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, our major trade partners. Our growing oil industry would be well served by an expansion of shipyards in Veracruz."
 MEX_fund_the_navy: "Fund The Navy"
 MEX_fund_the_navy_desc: "We must be able to adapt to anything new our enemies throws at us. Increased funding to navy exercises will lead to a more efficient navy that can tactically outperform our enemies."
 MEX_expand_the_marines: "Expand The Marines"
 MEX_expand_the_marines_desc: "By ensuring that we can strike our enemies anywhere, anytime, we can reduce their offensive capabilities. If they always have to fear a landing, anywhere along their coastline, they can't deploy as much units on the front line. Thus our focus need to be on amphibious operations and marines."
 MEX_amphibious_operations: "Amphibious Operations"
 MEX_amphibious_operations_desc: "Unless our worst nightmares come true, this war will not be ended on American soil. Well-executed landings will need to be part of the path to victory."
 MEX_bureau_of_ships: "Bureau of Ships"
 MEX_bureau_of_ships_desc: "We will combine the Bureau of Construction and Repair and the Bureau of Engineering into one entity to oversee future naval developments. While we're at it, it may be time to investigate rumors of inefficient torpedo performance which the Bureau of Ordnance so vehemently deny."
 MEX_unrestricted_submarine_warfare: "Unrestricted Submarine Warfare"
 MEX_unrestricted_submarine_warfare_desc: "History has shown that whatever well-intentioned treaty tried to control submarine warfare is not worth the paper it is written on. We should not consider ourselves bound by something our enemies will ignore anyway."
 MEX_focus_raiding_navy: "Raiding Navy"
 MEX_focus_raiding_navy_desc: "We can't hope to catch up with the major naval powers of the world in contesting the surface against battleships and carriers. We should instead try to interdict enemy troop transports before they arrive to protect Mexico from invasion."
 MEX_fleet_submarines: "Fleet Submarines"
 MEX_fleet_submarines_desc: "Our most likely opponents in the naval war both rely on foreign trade, which has shown to be very vulnerable to submarines. These submarines would have to have very long range to allow them to cross the oceans and operate close to the enemy shore."
 MEX_escort_effort: "Escort Effort"
 MEX_escort_effort_desc: "Submarines constitute a danger to our merchant convoys. Focusing on development of new destroyer models will allow us to wage anti-submarine warfare efficiently."
 MEX_focus_brown_water_navy: "Brown Water Navy"
 MEX_focus_brown_water_navy_desc: "Mexico relies on outdated pre-Great War vessels to protect our trade near the coasts. We have been attempting to buy more modern ships from Spain and other powers, but progress is slow. We need to develop our naval strategies in case war engulfs Europe and spills over to the Western Hemisphere."
 MEX_convoy_tactics: "Convoy Tactics"
 MEX_convoy_tactics_desc: "Protecting our trade vessels is not just about escorts and effective intelligence, but also tactical choices in how to arrange our trade routes and routines."
 MEX_carrier_primacy: "Carrier Primacy"
 MEX_carrier_primacy_desc: "Air power will be needed in battles to come, and the most practical means of extending its range is the use of aircraft carriers. We must create more advanced and specialized models."
 MEX_bureau_of_aeronautics: "Bureau of Aeronautics"
 MEX_bureau_of_aeronautics_desc: "To meet the needs for naval aviation development, the Bureau of Aeronautics, which has been responsible for these matters for decades, will have to be expanded."

 MEX_battleship_primacy: "Battleship Primacy"
 MEX_battleship_primacy_desc: "With the Japanese denounciation of the Washington Naval Treaty, we may face another arms race on the oceans. We will ensure we have both the most and best battleships."
 MEX_focus_blue_water_navy: "Blue Water Navy"
 MEX_focus_blue_water_navy_desc: "Mexico has never been a naval power. In colonial times, our Spanish overlords needed all their ships to face the British. During the independence struggle and civil wars following it, all our attentions were focused inwards. After America overtook us and became a Great Power, there was no point trying to contest the seas. But perhaps in these turbulent times Mexico will need a powerful navy."
 MEX_advanced_basing: "Advanced Basing"
 MEX_advanced_basing_desc: "The further we can keep the enemy from our shores, the better."
 MEX_advanced_mahanian_doctrine: "Advanced Mahanian Doctrine"
 MEX_advanced_mahanian_doctrine_desc: "The influence of Alfred Thayer Mahan on naval warfare can hardly be underestimated. Building on his work will allow us to make good use of battleships, which he considered a decisive factor."

 MEX_liberty_ships_desc: "Mass-production of cargo ships need to accompany our industrial developments to ensure our materials and troops reach the theaters where they are needed."
 MEX_maritime_commission: "Maritime Commission"
 MEX_maritime_commission_desc: "While most laymen only focus on the warships, the true experts know that it is the humble cargo vessel that wins wars. To increase the amount of shipping available in times of war, we will form a special board to coordinate construction."
 MEX_focus_weapons_modernisation: "Weapons Modernization"
 MEX_focus_weapons_modernisation_desc: "Mexico had a fantastic small arms industry before the Revolution. The hated dictator Díaz, for all his faults, was keenly interested in weapons development. The experiments into automatic rifles during the Díaz era need investigation."
 MEX_focus_army_expansion_programme: "Army Expansion Program"
 MEX_focus_army_expansion_programme_desc: "Mexico has vast capacity for expanding the army, with the nation-building program of the Revolution uniting the self-interested provinces into a single Fatherland. Our patriotic citizens will come to the aid of the state if times are dire."
 MEX_focus_aerial_artillery: "Aerial Artillery"
 MEX_focus_aerial_artillery_desc: "We experimented with the use of bombers against 'soft' targets during the Cristero War, and numerous other rebellions by unruly generals. Insurrectionists are unable to contest the skies, and thus bomber support will be essential to safeguarding the Mexican state."
 MEX_focus_tank_workshops: "Tank Workshops"
 MEX_focus_tank_workshops_desc: "Our aircraft designer, TNCA, experimented with armored fighting vehicles during the Great War, creating a prototype based on the British rhombus designs. We should restart these experiments and create a tank workshop."
 MEX_focus_heroic_military_college: "Heroic Military College"
 MEX_focus_heroic_military_college_desc: "The Colegio Militar was founded in 1823 and acquired the honorific of Heroico after five of its cadets fought to the death against American Marines during the 1847 Mexican-American war. A sixth cadet wrapped himself in the Mexican flag and hurled himself from the walls to avoid capture."
 MEX_focus_control_the_army: "Control the Army"
 MEX_focus_control_the_army_desc: "The army is perhaps the most important constituency in Mexico. The past twenty years have shown that the will of the people can only be enforced by bayonets. Rogue generals are therefore a threat to the very existence of the state, let alone its legitimacy."
 MEX_focus_revolutionary_women: "Revolutionary Women"
 MEX_focus_revolutionary_women_desc: "Traditionally associated with domestic work, women have also performed industrial labor for decades in Mexico. The tobacco, coffee and clothing industries tend to hire a majority of women, although this has caused friction with the male-dominated trades union movement. Men already have a right to equal pay for equal work and a minimum wage - we should enforce this right for women, as well."
 MEX_focus_soldaderas: "Soldaderas"
 MEX_focus_soldaderas_desc: "An iconic part of the Revolution, women soldiers fought in the rank and file and some were promoted to junior officer positions. They were especially important for the logistics of the poorly provisioned Revolutionary armies."
 MEX_focus_caudillo_private_armies: "Caudillo Private Armies"
 MEX_focus_caudillo_private_armies_desc: "The governors, businessmen and garrison commanders in a region tend to be the same man - a Revolutionary general who accrues power by appointing loyal underlings to positions of influence. These caudillos are a fact of life which we should cultivate, not fight against."
 MEX_focus_arrest_general_cedillo: "Arrest General Cedillo"
 MEX_focus_arrest_general_cedillo_desc: "The caudillos are a menace. They divide Mexico into petty fiefdoms where their appointment of officials gives them power over the economy, military and government. They are looting the wealth of Mexico, and nowhere is this more true than in the province of General Saturnino Cedillo. His independence from the central government is utterly intolerable, and the rebels he is amassing will not avail him."
 MEX_focus_support_general_cedillo: "Support General Cedillo"
 MEX_focus_support_general_cedillo_desc: "The Northern General Saturnino Cedillo and other caudillos like him need assurances that their autonomy will be respected by the government. The rapid centralization of power under presidents Calles and Cárdenas has allowed us to bring massive weight to bear on the problems facing the nation, so further dispossession of the caudillos is not needed."
 MEX_focus_depoliticised_army: "Depoliticized Army"
 MEX_focus_depoliticised_army_desc: "The generals have no right to the allegience of their soldiers. The ultimate source of legitimacy is the Mexican state. We should prevent the generals entertaining any thoughts of rebellion by rotating them between provinces so that they cannot build up patronage networks or secure the personal loyalty of their soldiers."
 MEX_focus_professional_army: "Escuela Superior de Guerra"
 MEX_focus_professional_army_desc: "We cannot rely on ad hoc soldaderas to provision the troops in the field, we need supply depots and a logistics corps. In the Military School our army chiefs and officers will acquire advanced military knowledge that will enable them to develop efficient supply systems. \nAt this point, even donkeys would be an improvement over leaving the troops to forage supplies for themselves."
 MEX_focus_ban_political_militias: "Ban Political Militias"
 MEX_focus_ban_political_militias_desc: "The left- and right-wing paramilitaries claim to be patriots fighting national traitors, but in truth they are pawns of foreign powers who seek to destabilize the country for nefarious ends. The government must clamp down on the fascist and communist militias."
 MEX_military_college: "Create the Escuela Superior de Guerra"
 MEX_military_college_desc: "One major aspect of what makes a professional army is a trained and large officer corps. Our army is short on experienced officers on all levels of the command structure, so we will need to expand our military colleges to train more officers. We shall begin this initiative by creating the Escuela Superior de Guerra in the capital, serving as the centerpiece of our new officer training programs."
 MEX_citizen_soldier: "Citizen Soldiers"
 MEX_citizen_soldier_desc: "A guerilla force should not only be made up of professional soldiers, but every citizen should also be able to participate in the fight against the enemy. Every citizen has a duty to protect their beloved country, resorting to the trusty Mondragon, which will be given to every servant of Mexico. With special citizen militias, we can make sure that every citizen will be able to fulfill his or her duties to Mexico."
 MEX_die_standing: "Die Standing"
 MEX_die_standing_desc: "Not a single meter of Mexican soil shall fall to the counter-revolutionaries and the imperialists! Our glorious soldiers shall defend every corner of Mexico, and they shall never yield! Mexico shall stay free, no matter the cost."
 MEX_focus_womens_suffrage: "Women's Suffrage"
 MEX_focus_womens_suffrage_desc: "Many legislators and cabinet ministers of the Revolutionary governments opposed the extension of the right to vote for women because they believed women would be more easily swayed by the arguments of the clergy and would end the program of secularization. Whatever the case in the past, we cannot stand in the path of progress."
 MEX_general_staff: "Herederos de Guadalupe Victoria"
 MEX_general_staff_desc: "The most effective fighting force is a professional, well regulated regular army, such as the army that Guadalupe Victoria led in order to free us from the Spanish centuries ago. However, our armed forces are quite the opposite. We need to reform most aspects of our army in order to move past this period of revolutionary rabble to be more organized like our national forefathers, and we should start with the general staff and the command structure."
 MEX_legacy_of_the_wars: "Legacy Of The Wars"
 MEX_legacy_of_the_wars_desc: "The lasting war was really a shame to our country. Therefore, we will sum up the lessons well, and our army in the new era must not fall in the same ditch again."
 MEX_future_of_war: "Future of Warfare"
 MEX_future_of_war_desc: "The future of warfare is dependent on the future of the equipment used. In order to prepare for the conflicts of tomorrow, which will undoubtedly challenge the integrity and freedom of Mexico, we will need to think today about the future of equipment."
 MEX_trundlers_of_the_sonora: "Trundlers of the Sonora"
 MEX_trundlers_of_the_sonora_desc: "If there is one thing that modern conflicts have taught Mexico, it is that the armored tank will be the harbinger of victory. We must ensure that the Mexican armor corps are superb to those of the northern Yankees. We shall be impervious defensibly, and unstoppable offensively."
 MEX_mechanized_warfare: "Request DINA Armor Designs"
 MEX_mechanized_warfare_desc: "While the strength of our Mexican soldiers is high, and while the strength of a Mexican artillery piece is even higher, the strength of a Mexican tank is the highest! We need to mechanize our forces so that no regular enemy force can defeat us."
 MEX_industrial_warfare: "Invest in Productos Mendoza"
 MEX_industrial_warfare_desc: "While the strength of our Mexican soldiers is high, the strength of a Mexican artillery piece is even higher. We need to equip our army with heavy infantry-support weapons to improve its fighting capabilities against a regular enemy force."
 MEX_solderas: "Soldaderas"
 MEX_solderas_desc: "During the Mexican Revolution, many women fought for the principles of the revolution. These 'soldaderas' have proven their strength and will on the battlefield, but women are still frowned upon in the military. We should end this discrimination and permit women to fight in our armed forces."
 MEX_guerilla_warfare: "Guerra de Guerrilas"
 MEX_guerilla_warfare_desc: "Mexico's terrain is extremely harsh with various deserts, mountain ranges, and jungles. Already during the Mexican Revolution, guerrilla tactics have proven to be highly effective in such terrain which doesn't permit for large, heavily-equipped armies. While we continue our industrialization efforts, establishing local militias and guerilla training will keep our regime safe for now."
 MEX_improve_soldiers: "Promote the Heroico Colegio Militar"
 MEX_improve_soldiers_desc: "In order to train the next generation of Mexican officers, we shall grant great funding to the Heroico Colegio Militar and implement a series of officer competency tests in order to weed out those placed in our ranks through nepotism. The academy shall work in tandem with our current military and government to ensure we have a steady flow of intelligent, calm, and calculated recruits to lead our men in the future."
 MEX_reapers_of_borders: "Reapers of the Border"
 MEX_reapers_of_borders_desc: "Mexico must be kept safe from all sides - Pacific, Caribbean, North, and South. Every inch of Mexican heartland will be paid for by the enemy, in gallons upon gallons of spilt blood, blood spilt by our great, patriotic men."
 MEX_jungle_training: "Yucateco Stratagems"
 MEX_jungle_training_desc: "The revolution started out in the jungles of Southern Mexico, and the revolution shall be spread through the jungles of Central and Latin America. Our army should focus on adapting to this extremely hostile terrain, as it will form the battlefield of the future wars."
 MEX_desert_training: "Learn from División del Norte"
 MEX_desert_training_desc: "One of our largest rivals on the American continent is the United States of America, which tries to undermine Mexico's freedom. The Mexican-American border is mostly made of deserts and arid mountains, so we should train our soldiers to stop the US forces in this hostile environment. Luckily, the División del Norte is expert at fighting in these conditions, so we shall expand these desert riders and have them teach the rest of the army."
 MEX_militias_training: "Militias Training"
 MEX_militias_training_desc: "The people will be encouraged to form up militias in defense of their homeland. This will enable larger parts of the population to be eligible for recruitment to military service, later."
 MEX_decentralized_command: "Adapt the Revolutionaries' Doctrines"
 MEX_decentralized_command_desc: "It is difficult to command a guerilla unit in the deserts of Sonora or the jungles of Yucatan from Mexico City, and precious hours and minutes can be lost waiting for commands to come in from hundreds of miles away. Our command structure should be more decentralized with local commanders having enough autonomy to perform well during guerilla attacks."
 MEX_recon_scouts: "Vigila las Dunas"
 MEX_recon_scouts_desc: "An invading army fears the ambush, where the strength of numbers and firepower means nothing against the element of surprise an abject terror. However, coordinating a perfect ambush is difficult, even for a veteran unit. To help facilitate this, elite scout units will be trained to locate and corral enemy armies like sheepdogs."
 MEX_night_ambushes: "Hunters of the Night"
 MEX_night_ambushes_desc: "An invading army can get overwhelmed or lost when encroaching on the mountainous mazes that dot the Mexican countryside. This hopelessness can be multiplied tenfold when they are harried at night by complete darkness, accompanied by the flashes of our rifles. We should undergo extreme night training regiments so our soldiers become hunters of the night, as deadly as the stalking jaguar, ambushing enemy forces and slinking back into the night like ghosts."
 MEX_focus_interior_defence_plan: "Interior Defense Plan"
 MEX_focus_interior_defence_plan_desc: "It's true that the Yanquis have a numerical and technological advantage over us, but we have knowledge of the terrain, support from the people, and time and space to establish a strong defense. We will bleed the enemy in the deserts and mountains using hit-and-run tactics, defense-in-depth, and hidden strongpoints."
 MEX_focus_coastal_defence_plan: "Coastal Defense Plan"
 MEX_focus_coastal_defence_plan_desc: "The Americans showed us in 1846 that, while we have deserts and mountains to give us strategic depth to our north, our littoral flanks are vulnerable to an amphibious invasion. We should add coastal defenses to our Gulf and Pacific ports and cities."
 MEX_modern_division_structure: "Study Imperial German Order of Battle"
 MEX_modern_division_structure_desc: "A modern division has a complicated structure, meanwhile a Mexican division is just a few infantry battalions. We need to completely restructure the division template of the Mexican armed forces."
 MEX_small_unit_tactics: "The Basic Unit of the Army"
 MEX_small_unit_tactics_desc: "Guerilla units have to be flexible and small. Large platoons or divisions do not allow this, and in turn, are not feasible for our army. We must decentralize all of our armed forces, and our military schools must evolve small unit tactics that prioritize mobility and flexibility over standard army formations and procedures."
 MEX_professional_army: "Memories of the Great Caudillos"
 MEX_professional_army_desc: "The goal of our major military reforms is to create a professional, modern army like that organized by the great independence heroes Santa Anna or Vicente Guerrero. While we will aspire to create a modern army by improving our equipment and tactics, a professional army can only be achieved if every soldier knows his duties and is willing to fulfill them under any condition."
 MEX_centralized_command: "A New Age Beyond the Revolution"
 MEX_centralized_command_desc: "If we give local commanders too much autonomy, our armed forces and HQ will drown in chaos once we meet the enemy as no one will know what exactly is happening. We need a regulated and centralized command structure to properly lead the army."
 MEX_siempre_leales: "Siempre Leales"
 MEX_siempre_leales_desc: "The Mexican military will always loyally serve Mexico, no matter the cost. It will always protect our beautiful nation, in war or in peace, from any threat, foreign or internal. 'Siempre Leales', Always Loyal."
 MEX_flexiable_planning: "Elastic Plans and Flexible Strategies"
 MEX_flexiable_planning_desc: "Helmuth von Moltke the Elder accurately said that 'no battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy', and that has been perfectly proven by the chaotic battles of the Mexican Revolution. Our plans need to be flexible so that they can adapt to new circumstances quickly."
 MEX_logistics: "Conquest of the Impassable"
 MEX_logistics_desc: "Due to our harsh terrain and underdeveloped infrastructure, it will be difficult to properly supply a large army with much heavy equipment. We need special units which oversee and organize the supply lines to keep our army always fully equipped."
 MEX_focus_heavy_artillery: "Heavy Artillery"
 MEX_focus_heavy_artillery_desc: "The killing power of field artillery is undeniable. The Great War showed the world how essential artillery is for supporting advances and breaking up enemy offensives. We must develop our conventional artillery."

 MEX_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser M02"
 MEX_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1902 is one of several Mauser rifles in service with the Mexican military, but is currently by far the most common. Chambered in 7x57mm, the Model 1902 is a highly modified Spanish Model 1893 Mauser integrating several parts and design elements from the later Mauser Model 1898. The Model 1902, which was purchased in large quantities from the German company DWM, is nearly identical to the domestically produced Model 1910."

 MEX_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mondragón M29"
 MEX_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The revolutionary Mondragón Model 1908 was among the first semi-automatic rifles to see combat, even serving with the German Luftstreitkräfte during the Weltkrieg. While effective, the Mondragón has always suffered reliability issues and is expensive to produce. The Model 1929 is a modernised and easier to manufacture version of the original Mondragón."
