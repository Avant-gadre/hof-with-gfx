A team of skilled Swedish arms designers ultimately managed to reduce the production costs of the rifle, and it was ultimately adopted by the Swedes despite still being quite complex.\nUpon returning to Finland, Carl Pelo successfully advocated the rifle's adoption in his native Finland, which previously lacked semi-automatic rifles entirely."

The gun began as an experiment by Aimo Lahti in hybridising the 8mm Mauser rifle cartridge with 9mm Parabellum; The new large pistol cartridge born from his experiments, however, became the central focus of subsequent Finnish arms design. The KP/-41 itself began as a derivative of Lahti's own 'Suomi' submachine gun rechambered for his new cartridge, and indeed, while retention of the general shape and feel of the KP/-31 was preferred, ultimately, the new design's massive recoil impetus led to both further external changes to the weapon's body as well as a reduction in its cyclic rate."

Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent.

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."
