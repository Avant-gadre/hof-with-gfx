 #Infantry Equip

 CAN_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Long, Ross Mk III"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Ross Mk III"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."
 CAN_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk V"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the loyal Dominions only had access to one arsenal capable of producing its service rifle. Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 CAN_infantry_equipment_2: "Carbine, Machine, Owen Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Gun"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 CAN_infantry_equipment_3: "Rifle, Self-Loading, Long Branch Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 CAN_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-tank No. 68"
 CAN_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 CAN_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 CAN_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 CAN_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 CAN_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 CAN_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 CAN_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 CAN_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 CAN_night_vision: "Tabby Scope"
 CAN_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 CAN_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Machine, Thompson Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States."
 CAN_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Carbine, Machine, Lanchester Mk I"
 CAN_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 CAN_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Commando, De Lisle Mk I"
 CAN_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "What began as a private venture by engineer William Godfray de Lisle soon caught the attention of the RCMP's Special Branch looking to equip agents with improved weaponry. The De Lisle carbine is, essentially, a shortened SMLE converted to .45 ACP, a subsonic cartridge with an integrated suppressor. The suppressor and ammunition together produced as little as 85.5 decibels when firing, making it very suitable for commando operations."

 CAN_armored_car_equipment_2_short: "Rhino"
 CAN_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "With the success of the Rover under its belt, the Ruskin Motor Bodies company designed the Rhino in response to an Australasian government request for a substantially heavier armoured car built upon the CMP chassis. Though substantial changes were made to that CMP chassis, after much work the Rhino was born, and with substantial interchangeability of parts with other CMP-based designs to boot."
 CAN_armored_car_at_equipment: "Ruskin Hippo"
 CAN_armored_car_at_equipment_short: "Hippo"
 CAN_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "To accommodate a substantially larger gun, the Rhino's coaxial machine had to be removed and its turret slightly enlarged. The 'Hippo' as this model has been designated, proved to be quite the headache for its design team, as these changes caused the already heavy vehicle to run into weight issues like its predecessors which had to be slowly worked out prior to the vehicle's adoption."
