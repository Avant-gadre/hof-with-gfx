 panay_incident.2.t: "USS Panay sunk in China!"
 panay_incident.2.d: "The gunboat USS Panay came under fire earlier today while evacuating civilians from the front line in the war between [JAP.GetName] and [CHI.GetName], despite being clearly marked with [USA.GetAdjective] flags. Struck with two bombs, she sank later that day with three US citizens killed and many more wounded. Survivors were picked up by [USA.GetAdjective] and [ENG.GetAdjective] gunboats in the area.\n\n[JAP.GetNameDef] has been quick to claim it was an accident and offer an apology, but some think that the attack was deliberate and a number of advisors are calling for war. However, public support for war remains low and any declaration is likely to be deeply divisive. How should we respond?"

How should we respond?"
 panay_incident.2.a: "Withdraw our forces from China"
 panay_incident.2.a.tt: "The public are deeply concerned about foreign entanglements. This incident would never have happened if our servicemen weren't in [CHI.GetName] in the first place. Withdrawing the small number of gunboats and personnel in China would help improve domestic stability, although it would also draw us further away from future military interventions.\n\n"
 panay_incident.2.e.tt: "With war support building, pulling out of [CHI.GetName] now would damage our efforts to to justify military action in the future, although reassuring the public of our desire for peace should help domestic stability.\n\n"
 panay_incident.2.b: "Demand compensation"
 panay_incident.2.b.tt: "Our demand will be put to the Japanese Government, and we should await their response.\n\n"
 panay_incident.2.c: "War!"
 panay_incident.2.c.tt: "While our much stronger industrial base is a key advantage, low public support would make war a risky proposition, and limit our capacity to become involved in other global developments.\n\n"
 panay_incident.3.t: "The [USA.GetName] demands an apology and compensation"
 panay_incident.3.d: "In response to our sinking of the USS Panay earlier this week, [USA.GetNameDef] has demanded an apology, punishment of the officers involved and compensation. While the attack was not ordered by our Government, it is not entirely clear whether it was a mistake by over-enthusiastic pilots or an attempt by military hardliners to encourage [USA.GetNameDef] and [ENG.GetName] to pull their forces out of [CHI.GetName]. Some in the Government will not like us agreeing to [USA.GetAdjective] terms, but a refusal could mean war."
 panay_incident.3.a: "Agree to [USA.GetAdjective] Terms"
 panay_incident.3.b: "We will never bow down to decadent Westerners!"
 panay_incident.3.b.tt: "Refusing [USA.GetAdjective] terms will be seen as a show of strength domestically, increasing support for our Government, but is it worth the risk of war with [USA.GetNameDef]?\n\n"
 panay_incident.4.t: "[JAP.GetName] agrees to provide compensation"
 panay_incident.4.d: "We have received a response from the [JAP.GetAdjective] ambassador agreeing to our demand of compensation for the sinking of USS Panay.  While public attitudes in [USA.GetNameDef] towards [JAP.GetName] will be influenced by these events for some time to come, war has \nbeen averted."
 panay_incident.4.a: "Thankfully [JAP.GetName] saw reason"
 panay_incident.5.t: "[JAP.GetName] refuses compensation"
 panay_incident.5.d: "It is clear the [JAP.GetAdjective] apology for the sinking of USS Panay was just lip service, as they have bluntly refused our request for compensation. This leaves us in a difficult situation, as the country is not ready for what will be an unpopular war, but backing down will hurt us politically and reinforce the public's anti-interventionist stance. However, stepping back from war will reassure voters that the Government means what it says about avoiding foreign entanglements."
 panay_incident.5.a: "War won't bring the USS Panay back"
 panay_incident.5.b: "We'll make [JAP.GetName] pay!"
 panay_incident.6.t: "[USA.GetName] pulls out of China"
 panay_incident.6.d: "The loss of USS Panay has raised fears of war in [USA.GetNameDef]. Clearly lacking appetite for a confrontation, [USA.GetAdjective] politicians have successfully lobbied for the withdrawal of all remaining [USA.GetAdjective] gunboats and personnel from China."
 panay_incident.6.a: "Their weakness is our strength"
